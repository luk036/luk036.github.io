### 🚀 Introduction: The Need for Approximate Computing ⚡

- Approximate computing (AxC) has emerged as a **new paradigm** 🌱 for high-performance 🏎️ and energy-efficient 🔋 circuit and system design.
- **Motivation 💡:** Challenges from massive data 📊 and complex computations in modern applications like AI 🤖.
- Conventional technologies face increasing challenges to improve circuit performance ⚡ and power efficiency ♻️.
- At the nanometer scale 📏, supply voltage reduction is limited, leading to significant **power density increases** 📈.
- This results in "dark silicon" ⚫ where parts of the chip must be powered off. Studies show dark silicon area can exceed 50% for 8-nm technology.

---

### 🤔 Why AxC ? 🧠

- Many applications like multimedia 🎬, recognition 👀, classification 🏷️, and machine learning 🧠 can **tolerate some errors** ❌.
- Humans have perceptual limitations 👂👁️, meaning errors might not be noticeable in output quality for image 🖼️, audio 🎵, or video 📹 processing.
- Input data is often noisy 📡 or quantized ⚖️, already limiting precision.
- Probability-based computing 🎲 (like stochastic computing) tolerates trivial errors.
- Iterative refinement processes 🔄 (like in machine learning) can attenuate or compensate for insignificant errors.
- AxC offers a potentially promising technique 💎 for various error-tolerant applications.

---

### 📜 Development History

- Early approaches since the 1960s 🕰️:
  - Newton–Raphson algorithm for approximate quotient calculation ➗ (speeding up division).
  - Functional iteration-based algorithms 🔁 (e.g., Goldschmidt).
  - Mitchell's logarithm-based algorithm for multiplication and division.
- Gradual adoption of straightforward approximation/rounding techniques 🔄, e.g., **truncation-based fixed-width multipliers** ✂️.
- Early 2000s 🎆: Concept of approximation applied to adders ➕ and Booth multipliers to increase clock frequency ⏱️.
  - Approximate adder idea 💡: Effective carry chain ⛓️ shorter than full chain; critical path reduced by using previous k bits (k < n) for carry prediction 🔮.
- Since ~2008 📅: **Significant attention** 👀 to approximate adders ➕ and multipliers ✖️, leading to various designs (ACA, ETM, UDM, LOA, ESA, etc.).

### 🛠️ Design Methodologies 🧰

- An approximate arithmetic circuit can be obtained via:
  1.  **Voltage Overscaling (VOS) ⚡**:
      - Lower supply voltage 🔋 to reduce power.
      - Increases critical path delay ⏳, potentially causing timing errors.
      - Error characteristics are **nondeterministic** 🎲 and affected by variations. Large errors possible if MSBs are affected.
  2.  **Redesigning Logic Circuits 🖥️**:
      - Modifying, removing, or adding elements to an accurate circuit.
      - Simplifying truth tables 📊 or Karnaugh maps 🗺️.
      - Results in circuits with **deterministic error characteristics** ✅.
  3.  **Simplification Algorithms ➗➖**:
      - Converting complex operations (multiplication ✖️, division ➗, square root √) into simpler ones (addition ➕, subtraction ➖) using algorithms like Mitchell's.
      - Can significantly improve performance ⚡ and energy efficiency 🔋 due to simpler basic structure.
      - Accuracy tends to be **relatively low** 📉.

---

### 📏 Evaluation Metrics 📐

- Both **error characteristics ❌** and **circuit measurements 🛠️** must be considered.

1. 📊 Error Characteristics ❌
   - Various metrics and analytical approaches are used [18, 49, 66–73]. Monte Carlo simulation 🎲 is common.
   - **Error Rate (ER) 📉:** Probability of producing an erroneous result.
   - **Error Distance (ED) 📏:** Arithmetic difference between approximate (M') and accurate (M) results: |M' - M|.
   - **Relative Error Distance (RED) ⚖️:** Relative difference w.r.t. accurate result: |ED / M|.
     - For same ED, smaller M results in larger RED.
   - **Mean ED (MED) 📊** and **Mean RED (MRED) 📈:** Average values used to assess overall accuracy.

  2.  **Segmented Adders 🧩:** Divide adder into segments, process segments in parallel. Inputs may overlap. Examples: ESA, ETAII, ACAA.
  3.  **Carry-Select Adders 🔀:** Use multiplexers to select sum/carry based on predicted carry. Examples: SCSA, CCA, CSA, GCSA, BCSA, CSPA.
  4.  **Approximate Full Adders (AFAs) ➕:** Approximate the FA cell itself. Use AFAs for LSBs and accurate adders for MSBs. Examples: LOA (uses OR gate as AFA). Other AFA designs exist [29, 20, 104–106].
