### What are Multiplierless Designs? 🤔💭🔍

- Digital Signal Processing (DSP) kernels like transforms 🔄 and filters 🧩 often involve multiplications by constants.
- Instead of using dedicated hardware multipliers (which can be costly in terms of area 📏 and power ⚡), these constant multiplications can be implemented using only **additions ➕, subtractions ➖, and shifts ⏩**.
- This implementation technique is called "**multiplierless**".
- Example: `y = 5x` can be computed as `y = (x << 2) + x` (shift `x` left by 2 bits ⏩, then add `x` ➕). This uses one shift ⏩ and one addition ➕ instead of a full multiplier.
- These designs are primarily of interest for **hardware implementations** (like FPGAs 🖥️ and VLSI 🔌) but can also benefit software 💾 for certain processors.

### Why Go Multiplierless? ✨🏆💡

- **Hardware Efficiency** 🏗️⚡: Multiplierless implementations are used to avoid costly multipliers in hardware.
- **Reduced Area** 📉🏠: Implemented using networks of additions ➕ and shifts ⏩, which can be smaller than dedicated multipliers.
- **Lower Power Consumption** 🔋💡: Generally consume less power compared to multiplier-based designs.
- **Potential for Higher Speed** ⚡🏎️: Can sometimes lead to higher operating frequencies depending on the specific design and optimization.

- This approach is especially relevant for mobile 📱🏃‍♂️ and embedded applications with stringent area 📏 and power ⚡ requirements.

---

### How are Multiplierless Designs Achieved? 🛠️🔧⚙️

- The core idea is replacing multiplication ✖️ with a combination of **shifts ⏩ and additions ➕/subtractions ➖**.
- A collection of operations that multiply a single input by one or more constants is called a **multiplier block**.
- For multiple constants, the problem becomes **Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM)** 🔢.

---

### Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM) & CSE 🌱🔍🧩

- In MCM, the goal is to compute multiple constant multiplications simultaneously, sharing common intermediate results to minimize cost (number of additions ➕/subtractions ➖).
- **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)** is a key technique used in multiplierless design.
- CSE searches for 🔍 and eliminates redundant bit patterns common across several coefficients, sharing the computation of these patterns.
- Different CSE approaches exist, including **horizontal ↔️, vertical ↕️, oblique ⬇️, and combinations** 🔀.
- While CSE helps, it may not find _all_ sharing opportunities due to its dependency on the number representation.
- **Graph-based approaches** 📊🌐 are also commonly used in state-of-the-art MCM methods to overcome limitations of CSE.

### Multiplierless in Applications 🎯📱🔌

- Multiplierless techniques are widely applied in **linear DSP kernels** 📈.
- **Filters** 🧩: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters are common applications.
- **Transforms** 🔄: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) utilize multiplierless implementations.
- **Filter Banks** 🏦 and **Polyphase Filters** also benefit.
- The choice of number representation (e.g., Canonical Signed Digit - CSD) can also facilitate sharing opportunities.

### Multiplierless FIR Filter Design 📉🎛️🔍

- A key area of multiplierless design.
- Design flow often starts with functional frequency domain specifications, number of coefficients, and word lengths.
- Optimization procedures yield bounded integer coefficients and associated adder circuits for constant multiplications (MCM).
- **Parameters and Interactions** 🔄⚙️: Filter coefficients, word lengths, number of filter coefficients (N), size of wordlength (b), adder cost (number of additions ➕/subtractions ➖), adder depth, filter order, gain.
- Optimization aims to minimize adder cost subject to frequency response specifications.
- The relationship between word length and cost is nonlinear, suggesting comprehensive design space exploration is beneficial.
- Coefficient choice can be a criterion during filter design itself, not just implementation.

---

### Optimizing FIR Filters ⚙️🔍📊

- Methods involve selecting integer coefficients and associated adder circuits.
- Approaches include CSE and graph-based MCM algorithms.
- More advanced methods use **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** optimization based on a pre-specified or dynamically expanded set of sharable terms.
- Fast **polynomial-time heuristics** are also used for low complexity designs.
- Comprehensive exploration of design parameters like effective word length (B), filter type, and filter order (N) can lead to lower implementation costs. Allowing variable gain can also significantly influence results.
- Some state-of-the-art methods can improve upon previous results by reducing the number of adders ➕ or adder depth. Higher sparsity in the design can sometimes lead to a 2-stage adder depth design with lower cost.

---

### Multiplierless Transforms 🖼️🎶🔄

- Linear DSP transforms like DCT, DFT, and DWT consist of additions ➕ and multiplications ✖️ by constants.
- Multiplierless implementations use adder/shift networks for these constant multiplications.
- Cost is determined by the number of additions ➕, influenced by constant value and precision.
- For DWT (e.g., 5/3 wavelet base), multiplierless schemes with integer data can result in significantly lower internal signal length compared to multiplier-based schemes. Hardware resources like slice registers and LUTs are used in FPGA implementations of multiplierless DWT.

---

### Automated Design & Optimization for Transforms 🤖⚡🔧

- Designing multiplierless transforms involves choosing a numerically robust algorithm and configuring constant precisions to minimize additions ➕ while meeting error constraints.
- These steps can be challenging due to the large number of configurations and the unpredictable impact of precision reduction on output error.
- Automated methods have been developed for:
  - **Automatic robust algorithm selection** 🤖📊.
  - **Automatic configuration of constant precisions** ⚙️🔢.
- These tools can explore a large number of design points and investigate the tradeoff between resource constraints and implementation quality. This offers a flexible alternative to static IP design reuse.

---

### Conclusion 🎉🏁✨

- Multiplierless designs are essential for implementing linear DSP kernels efficiently, especially in hardware, by replacing multiplications ✖️ with additions ➕, subtractions ➖, and shifts ⏩.
- MCM and CSE are core techniques for optimizing these implementations by sharing common subexpressions.
- Future work includes developing integrated design methodologies and tools to better link application requirements to low-level circuit design choices.

Thank you! 🙏✨🚀
