# Project Overview

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base, containing a collection of notes, presentations, and learning materials across various topics. The content is primarily organized into subdirectories, with each subdirectory focusing on a specific subject area. The materials are likely presented in HTML format, possibly generated from Markdown or other source formats.

# Key Files and Directories

*   **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the repository and links to the main content areas.
*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point for the website, likely serving as a table of contents or a landing page.
*   **`style.css`**: Contains the styling rules for the HTML content, defining the visual appearance of the presentations and documents.
*   **`package.json`**: Lists development dependencies, currently including `prettier` for code formatting.
*   **Content Subdirectories (e.g., `algo4dfm/`, `AxC/`, `rust_by_examples/`, `proglang/`, `fun/`, `net_optim/`, `n_sphere/`, `cvx/`, `statistics/`, `projgeom/`, `phys_des/`)**: These directories contain the core content, organized by topic. Each typically includes HTML files (e.g., `index.html`) and potentially source files (e.g., `.md` files) from which the HTML is generated.

# Usage

The primary usage of this repository is to view the various HTML presentations and documents.

*   **Viewing Content**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to navigate through the different topics. Individual topic pages can be accessed via the links provided in the `README.md` or `index.html`.
*   **Code Formatting**: The `prettier` tool is used for maintaining consistent code style. You can run `npx prettier --write .` to format all supported files in the repository.

**Building and Serving Content**:
(TODO: The exact commands for building and serving the HTML content are not immediately apparent from the `package.json` or `README.md`. Further investigation into the project's build process would be required to document these steps.)
