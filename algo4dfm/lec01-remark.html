"Slippery Fish" at 45nm
-----------------------

-   Process variation, impacting yield and performance
-   More restricted design rules (RDRs)
    -   +3 or more rules at 45nm
    -   +100 or more rules at 32nm
    -   +250 or more rules at 22nm
-   More rules implies larger die size, lower performance
-   10nm is not sci-fiction due to FinFET technology

DFM
===

---

What is DFM?
------------

-   Design for 💰?
-   Design for Manufacturing
-   Design for Manufacturability
    - Refer to a group of challenges less than 130nm 
    - The engineering practice of designing integrated circuits (ICs) to optimize their manufacturing ease and production cost given performance, power and reliability requirements
    - A set of techniques to modify the design of ICs to improve their functional yield, parametric yield or their reliability

---

## Why is it important?

- Achieving high-yielding designs in the state-of-the-art VLSI technology is extremely challenging due to the miniaturization and complexity of leading-edge products
- The manufacturing process becomes more sensitive to variations and defects, which can degrade the quality and functionality of the chips
- DFM can help to address various manufacturing issues, such as lithography hotspots, CMP dishing and erosion, antenna effects, electromigration, stress effects, layout-dependent effects and more

---

## How is it applied?

- DFM can be applied to various aspects of IC design, such as circuit design, logic design, layout design, verification and testing
- Each aspect has its own specific DFM guidelines and best practices that designers should follow to ensure manufacturability
- For example, some general DFM guidelines for layout design are:
  - Use regular and uniform layout structures
  - Avoid narrow or long metal wires
  - Avoid acute angles or jogs in wires
  - Avoid isolated or floating features
  - Use dummy fill to improve planarity and density uniformity
  - Use recommended design rules and constraints from foundries

---

## What are the benefits?

- By applying DFM techniques in the physical design stage of IC development, designers can:
  - Reduce the number of design iterations
  - Improve the collaboration with foundries
  - Enhance the product performance and functionality
  - Achieve faster time to market and lower production costs

Redundant Via Insertion
-----------------------

-   Also known as double via insertion.
-   Post-routing RVI (many EDA tools already have this feature)
-   Considering RVI during routing

![RVI](lec01.files/image038.jpg)

???

Looks good, right?

But actually only few people are using this!

Why?

---

Multiple Patterning (MPL)
-------------------------

-   Instead of exposing the photoresist layer once under one mask, MPL
    exposes it twice by splitting the mask into "k" parts, each with
    features less dense.

---

## What are the challenges of DFM?

- DFM is not a fixed set of rules, but rather a flexible and evolving methodology that depends on the product requirements, the manufacturing technology and the industry standards
- DFM can also be combined with other design methodologies, such as DFT, DFR, DFLP and DFS, to create a holistic approach to product development
- DFM requires strong capabilities in research, supply chain, talent, IP protection and government policies

-   Describe the DFM problems that arise from.
-   Abstract the problems in mathematical forms
-   Describe the algorithms that solve the problems
-   Discuss the alternative algorithms and possible improvement.
-   Discuss if the algorithms can be applied to other area.
-   Only describe the key idea in lectures. Details are left for paper
    reading if necessary.
