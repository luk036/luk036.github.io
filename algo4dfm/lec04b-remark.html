A simple example: the area of a triangle
====================================

---

A Simple Area Problem
---------------------

-   Suppose the points $p$, $q$ and $r$ vary within the region of 3 given rectangles.
-   Q: What is the upper and lower bound on the area of $\triangle pqr$?

Method 1: Corner-based
----------------------

-   Calculate all the areas of triangles with different *corners*.
-   Problems:
    -   In practical applications, there may be many corners.
    -   What's more, in practical applications, the worst-case scenario may not be at the corners at all.

---

Method 2: Monte Carlo
---------------------

-   Monte-Carlo or Quasi Monte-Carlo:
    -   Calculate the area of triangles for different sampling points.
-   Advantage: more accurate when there are more sampling points.
-   Disadvantage: time consuming

Interval Arithmetic vs. Affine Arithmetic
=========================================

---

Method 3: Interval Arithmetic
-----------------------------

-   Interval arithmetic (IA) estimation:
    -   Let px = [2, 3], py = [3, 4]
    -   Let qx = [-5, -4], qy = [-6, -5]
    -   Let rx = [6, 7] , ry = [-5, -4]
-   Area of triangle:
    -   = ((qx - px)(ry - py) - (qy - py)(rx - px))/2
    -   = [33 .. 61] (actually [36.5 .. 56.5])
-   Problem: cannot handle *correlation* between variables.

---

Method 4: Affine Arithmetic
---------------------------

-   (Definition to be given shortly)
-   More accurate estimation than IA:
    -   Area = [35 .. 57] in the previous example.
-   Take care of first-order correlation.
-   Usually faster than Monte-Carlo, but ....
    -   becomes inaccurate if the variations are large.
-   libaffa.a/YALAA package is publicly available:
    -   Provides functuins like +, -, \*, /, sin(), cos(), pow() etc.

---

Analog Circuit Example
----------------------

-   Unit Gain bandwidth
    -   `GBW = sqrt(A*Kp*Ib*(W2/L2)/(2*pi*Cc)` where some parameters are varying

---

Enabling Technologies
---------------------

-   C++ template and operator overloading features greatly simplify the coding effort:
-   E.g., the following code can be applied to both `<double>` and `<AAF>`:

    ```cpp
    template <typename Tp>
    Tp area(const Tp& px, const Tp& qx, const Tp& rx,
            const Tp& py, const Tp& qy, const Tp& ry) {
        return ((qx-px)*(ry-py) - (qy-py)*(rx-px)) / 2;
    }
    ```

-   In other words, some existing code can be reused with minimal modification.

---

Applications of AA
------------------

-   Analog Circuit Sizing
-   Worst-Case Timing Analysis
-   Statistical Static Timing Analysis
-   Parameter Variation Interconnect Model Order Reduction [CMU02]
-   Clock Skew Analysis
-   Bounded Skew Clock Tree Synthesis

---

Limitations of AA
-----------------

-   Something AA can't replace `<double>`:
    -   Iterative methods (no fixed point in AA)
    -   No Multiplicative inverse operation (no LU decomposition)
    -   Not total ordering, can't sort (???)
-   AA can only handle linear correlation, which means you can't expect an accurate approximation of `abs(x)` near zero.
-   Fortunately the ellipsoid method is one of the few algorithms that works with AA.

---

Circuit Sizing for Op. Amp.
---------------------------

-   Geometric Programming formulation for CMOS Op. Amp.
-   Min-max convex programming under Parametric variations (PVT)
-   Ellipsoid Method (see next lecture)

---

What is Affine Arithmetic?
--------------------------

-   Represents a quantity x with an affine form (AAF):
    $$\hat{x} = x_0 + x_1 \epsilon_1 + \ldots + x_n \epsilon_n$$ where
    -   noise symbols $\epsilon_i \in [-1, 1]$
    -   central value $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$
    -   partial deviations $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$
    -   $n$ is not fixed - new noise symbols are generated during the computation process.
-   IA -\> AA : $[3..4] \rightarrow 3.5 + 0.5 \epsilon_1$

---

Geometry of AA
--------------

.pull-left70[

-   Affine forms that share noise symbols are dependent:
    -   $\hat{x} = x_0 + x_1 \epsilon_1 + \ldots + x_n \epsilon_n$
    -   $\hat{y} = y_0 + y_1 \epsilon_1 + \ldots + y_m \epsilon_m$
-   The region containing (x, y) is:
    -   $Z = \{(x, y) : \epsilon_i \in [-1, 1]\}$
    -   This region is a centrally symmetric convex polygon called "zonotope".

Comments
--------

-   The marriage of AA (algebra) and Zonotope (geometry) has the potential to provide us with a powerful tool for algorithm design.
-   AA does not solve all problems. E.g. Iterative method does not apply to AA because AA is not in the Banach space (the fixed-point theorem does not hold).
-   AA \* and + do not obey the laws of distribution (c.f. floating-point arithmetic)
-   AA can only perform first-order approximations. In other words, it can only be applied to nearly linear variations.
-   In practice, we still need to combine AA with other methods, such as statistical method or the (quasi-) Monte Carlo method.
