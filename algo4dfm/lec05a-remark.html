![img](lec05.files/fig03.png)

-   $T_\text{skew}(i,f) = t_i - t_f$, where
    -   $t_i$: clock signal delay at the initial register
    -   $t_f$: clock signal delay at the final register

] .pull-right30[

---

Timing Constraint
-----------------

-   Setup time constraint
    $$T_\text{skew}(i,f) \le T_\text{CP} - D_{if} - T_\text{setup} = u_{if}$$
    While this constraint destroyed, cycle time violation (zero
    clocking) occurs.

-   Hold time constraint
    $$T_\text{skew}(i,f) \ge T_\text{hold} - d_{if} = l_{if}$$ While
    this constraint destroyed, race condition (double clocking) occurs.

---

Zero skew vs. Useful skew
-------------------------

-   Zero skew ($t_i = t_f$) : Relatively easy to implement.

-   Useful skew. Improve:
    -   The performance of the circuit by permitting a higher maximum
        clock frequency, or
    -   The safety margins of the clock skew within the permissible
        ranges.

-   Max./min. path delays are obtained from static timing analysis
    (STA).

---

Timing Constraint Graph
-----------------------

-   Create a graph by
    -   replacing the hold time constraint with an *h-edge* with cost
        $-(T_\text{hold} - d_{ij})$ from $\text{FF}_i$ to $\text{FF}_j$,
        and
    -   replacing the setup time constraint with an s-edge with cost
        $T_\text{CP} - D_{ij} - T_\text{setup}$ from $\text{FF}_j$ to
        $\text{FF}_i$.
-   Two sets of constraints stemming from clock skew definition:
    -   The sum of skews for paths having the same starting and ending
        flip-flop to be the same;
    -   The sum of clock skews of all cycles to be zero

---

Timing Constraint Graph (TCG)
-----------------------------

.pull-left[

Assume $T_\text{setup} = T_\text{hold}$ = 0

Clock period $T_\text{CP}$ is feasible if and only if current graph contains no
negative cost cycles.

---

Minimize Clock Period
---------------------

- Linear programming (LP) formulation
  $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{minimize}   & T_\text{CP} \\
      \text{subject to} & l_{ij} \leq T_i - T_j \leq u_{ij}
  \end{array}$$
  where $\text{FF}_i$ and $\text{FF}_j$ are sequential adjacent

- The above constraint condition is so called **system of difference
  constraints** (see Introduction to Algorithms, MIT):

- 👉 Note: easy to check if a feasible solution exists by detecting
  negative cycle using for example Bellman-Ford algorithm.

---

Basic Bellman-Ford Algorithm
----------------------------

```matlab
function BellmanFord(list vertices, list edges, vertex source)
    // Step 1: initialize graph
    for each vertex i in vertices:
        if i is source then u[i] := 0
        else u[i] := inf
        predecessor[i] := null

    // Step 2: relax edges repeatedly
    for i from 1 to size(vertices)-1:
        for each edge (i, j) with weight d in edges:
*           if u[j] > u[i] + d[i,j]:
*               u[j] := u[i] + d[i,j]
*               predecessor[j] := i

    // Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles
    for each edge (i, j) with weight d in edges:
        if u[j] > u[i] + d[i,j]:
            error "Graph contains a negative-weight cycle"
return u[], predecessor[]
```

---

Problems with Bellman-Ford Algorithm
------------------------------------

-   The algorithm is originally used for finding shortest paths.
-   Detecting negative cycle is just a side product of the algorithm.
-   The algorithm is simple, but...
    -   detects negative cycle at the end only.
    -   has to compute all `d[i,j]`.
    -   Restart the initialization with `u[i] := inf`.
    -   requests the input graph must have a source node.

Various improvements have been proposed extensively.

---

Minimize clock period (I)
-------------------------

-   Fast algorithm for solving the LP:
    -   Use binary search method for finding the minimum clock period.
    -   In each iteration, Bellman-Ford algorithm is called to detect if
        the timing constraint graph contains negative weighted edge
        cycle.
-   👉 Note: Originally Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find a
    shortest-path of a graph.

---

Minimize clock period (II)
--------------------------

-   When the optimal clock period is solved, the corresponding skew
    schedule is obtained simultaneously.

-   However, many skew values are on the bounds of feasible range.

![Timing uncertainty emerges under process
variations](lec05.files/fig07.png)

---

Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling
----------------------------------

-   When process variations increase more and more,
    timing-failure-induced yield loss becomes a significant problem.

-   Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling becomes important.

-   Primary goal of this scheduling is to minimize the yield loss
    instead of minimizing the clock period.

---

Timing Yield Definition
-----------------------

-   The circuit is called functionally correct if all the setup- and
    hold-time constraints are satisfied under a group of determinate
    process parameters.

-   Timing Yield = (functional correct times) / sample number \* 100%

---

Primitive solution (1)
----------------------

-   Preallocate timing margins (usually equivalent to maximum timing
    uncertainty) at both ends of the FSRs (Feasible Skew Region).
    $$l_{ij}  \leq s_{ij} \leq u_{ij} \implies l_{ij} + \Delta d \leq s_{ij}  \leq u_{ij} - \Delta d$$

-   Then perform clock period optimization.

---

Problems with this method
-------------------------

-   The maximum timing uncertainty is too pessimistic. Lose some
    performance;

-   $\Delta d$ is fixed; it does not consider data path delay
    differences between cycle edges.

    Clock Skew Scheduling", DAC'06

---

Primitive solution (2)
----------------------

-   Formulate as LCES (Least Center Error Square) problem
    -   A simple observation suggests that, to maximize slack, skew
        values should be chosen as close as possible to the middle
        points of their FSRs.

    $$l_{ij} + lm_k (u_{ij} - l_{ij}) \leq s_{ij}  \leq u_{ij} - um_k (u_{ij} - l_{ij})$$

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{minimize}   & \sum_k (0.5 - \min(lm_k, um_k) )^2 \\
      \text{subject to} & 0 \leq lm_k \leq 0.5 \\
      & 0 \leq um_k \leq 0.5
    \end{array}$$

    -   (I. S. Kourtev and E. G. Fredman, "Clock skew scheduling for
        improved reliability via quadratic programming", ICCAD'99)

Shortcoming: might reduce some slacks to be zero to minimum **total** CES.
This is not optimal for yield.

----------------------

-   Incremental Slack Distribution
    -   (Xinjie Wei, Yici CAI and Xianlong Hong, "Clock skew scheduling
        under process variations", ISQED'06)
-   Advantage: check all skew constraints

-   Disadvantage: didn't take the path delay difference into
    consideration

---

Minimum Mean Cycle Based
------------------------

-   **Even**: solve the slack optimization problem using a minimum mean
    cycle formulation.

-   **Prop**: distribute slack along the most timing-critical cycle
    proportional to path delays

-   **fp-Prop**: use sensitizable-critical-path search algorithm for
    clock skew scheduling.

---

Slack Maximization (EVEN)
-------------------------

- Slack Maximization Scheduling
  $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize}   & t \\
      \text{subject to} & T_j - T_i \leq \mu_{ij} - t
  \end{array}$$

- Equivalent to the so-called minimum mean cycle problem (MMC), where:
  $$t^* = \frac{1}{|C|} \sum\limits_{(i,j)\in C} \mu_{ij}$$ $C$:
  critical cycle (first negative cycle)

- Can be solved efficiently by the above method.

---

Even - iterative slack optimization
----------------------------------

-   Identify the circuit's most timing-critical cycle,

-   Distribute the slack along the cycle,

-   Freeze the clock skews on the cycle, and

-   Repeat the process iteratively.

-   $\text{Slack}_{31}$ = 1

where $\text{Slack}_{ij} = T_\text{CP} - D_{ij} - T_\text{setup} - \text{Skew}_{ij}$

]

---

Problems with Even
------------------

-   Assume all variances are the same.
-   However, the timing uncertainty of a long combinational path is
    usually larger than that of a shorter path.
-   Therefore, the even slack distribution along timing-critical cycles
    performed by **Even** is not optimal for yield if data path delays
    along the cycles are not the same.

---

Prop-Based on Gaussian model (I)
---------------------------------

-   Assuming there are $n$ gates with delay $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ in a path,
    then this path delay is $N(n\mu,n\sigma^2)$
-   Distribute slack along the most timing-critical cycle, according to
    the square root of each edge's path delays (???).
-   To achieve this, update the weights of s-edges and h-edges:
    $$\begin{array}{ll}
    T_\text{CP} - (D_{ij} + \alpha \sqrt{D_{ij}} \sigma) - T_\text{setup} \\
    -T_\text{hold} + (d_{ij} - \alpha \sqrt{d_{ij}} \sigma)
    \end{array}$$ where $\alpha$ ensures a minimum timing margin for
    each timing constraint.

---

Prop-Based on Gaussian model (II)
----------------------------------

-   Given a specific clock period $T_\text{CP}$, we gradually increase $\alpha$ and
    use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect whether it is still feasible.
-   After finding the maximum $\alpha$, the edges along the most
    timing-critical cycle will have slacks equal to the preallocated
    timing margins.
-   Many edges in a circuit have sufficiently large slack. Therefore, we
    can perform proportional slack distribution only for the most
    timing-critical cycle. Assign the rest of skews using **Even**.

---

Problems with Prop
------------------

-   Assume all gate delay has the same distribution.
-   Not justify using the square root of path delay for timing margin.

---

fp-Prop (I)
-----------

.pull-left70[

![img](lec05.files/fig18.png)
False path

]


---

fp-Prop (II)
------------

-   If we do not consider false path, some non timing-critical cycles
    become timing-critical. Then, more slacks are distributed to these
    cycles, but the slacks in actually timing-critical cycles are not
    sufficient. As a result, the overall timing yield decreases.

---

Problems with fp-Prop
---------------------

-   Same problems as Prop

---

🔬 Experimental results
--------------------

.pull-left70[

![img](lec05.files/fig20.png)

]

---

Statistical Method
------------------

-   Setup time constraint

    $$T_\text{skew}(i,f) \le T_\text{CP} - \tilde{D}_{if} - T_\text{setup}$$

-   Hold time constraint

    $$T_\text{skew}(i,f) \ge T_\text{hold} - \tilde{d}_{if}$$

    where $\tilde{D}_{if} \text{ and } \tilde{d}_{if}$
    are random variable under process variations.

---

Statistical TC Graph
--------------------

.pull-left70[

![img](lec05.files/tcgraph9.svg)

]

After SSTA, edge weight is represented as a pair of value (mean,
variance).

---

Most Critical Cycle
-------------------

-   Traditional criteria: minimum mean cycle
    $$\min_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{\sum_{(i,j)\in C} \mu_{ij} }{|C|}$$

-   New criteria:
    $$\min_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{\sum_{(i,j)\in C} \mu_{ij} }{\sum_{(i,j)\in C} \sigma_{ij}}$$

    (We show the correctness later)

---

Slack Maximization (C-PROP)
---------------------------

-   Slack Maximization Scheduling $$\begin{array}{ll}
        \text{maximize}   & t \\
        \text{subject to} & T_j - T_i \leq \mu_{ij} - \sigma_{ij} t
    \end{array}$$
-   Equivalent to the *minimum cost-to-time ratio* problem (MMC), where:
    -   $t^* = \sum_{(i,j)\in C} \mu_{ij} / \sum_{(i,j)\in C} \sigma_{ij}$
    -   $C$: critical cycle (first negative cycle)

---

Probability Observation
-----------------------

-   Prob(timing failure) turns out to be an Error function that solely
    depends on this ratio. Therefore, it is justified to use this ratio
    as critical criteria.

---

Whole flow
----------

-   After determining the clock arrival time at each vertex in the most
    critical cycle, the cycle is replaced with a super vertex $v'$.

-   In-edge $(u, v)$ from outside vertex $u$ to cycle member $v$ is
    replaced by an in-edge $(u, v')$ with weight mean
    $\mu(u, v) - T_v$.

-   Out-edge $(v, u)$ is replaced by out-edge $(v', u)$ with
    weight mean $\mu(v, u) + T_v$. However, the variance of the edge
    weight is not changed. And parallel edges can be remained.

-   Repeat the process iteratively until the graph is reduced to a
    single super vertex or the edges number is zero.

---

Data structure
--------------

![img](lec05.files/hierachy.svg)

Final result: $T_1=T_1+T_{s_1}+T_{s_3}$

---

Advantages of This Method
-------------------------

-   Justified by probability observation.
-   Fast algorithm exists for minimum cost-to-time ratio problem.
-   Reduce to Even when all variances are equal.
-   When a variance tends to zero, it makes sense that only minimal
    slack is assigned to this variable, and hence others can be assigned
    more.
