## Timing Constraint

- Setup time constraint
    $$T_{skew}(i,f) \le T_{CP} - D_{if} - T_{setup} = u_{if}$$
  While this constraint destroyed, cycle time violation (zero clocking) occurs.

- Hold time constraint
    $$T_{skew}(i,f) \ge T_{hold} - d_{if} = l_{if}$$
  While this constraint destroyed, race condition (double clocking) occurs.

---

## Zero skew vs. Useful skew

- Zero skew ($t_i = t_f$) :
    Relatively easy to implement.

- Useful skew. Improve:
  - The performance of the circuit by permitting a higher maximum clock frequency, or
  - The safety margins of the clock skew within the permissible ranges.

- Max./min. path delays are obtained from static timing analysis (STA).

---

## Timing Constraint Graph

- Create a graph by
  - replacing the hold time constraint with an *h-edge* with cost $-(T_{hold} - d_{ij})$ from $FF_i$ to $FF_j$, and
  - replacing the setup time constraint with an s-edge with cost  $T_{CP} - D_{ij} - T_{setup}$ from $FF_j$ to $FF_i$.

- Two sets of constraints stemming from clock skew definition:
  - The sum of skews for paths having the same starting and ending flip-flop to be the same;
  - The sum of clock skews of all cycles to be zero

---

## Minimize Clock Period

- Linear programming (LP) formulation
  $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{minimize}   & T_{CP} \\
      \text{subject to} & l_{ij} \leq T_i - T_j \leq u_{ij}
  \end{array}$$
  where $FF_i$ and $FF_j$ are sequential adjacent

- The above constraint condition is so called **system of difference constraints** (see Introduction to Algorithms, MIT):

- Note: easy to check if a feasible solution exists by detecting negative cycle using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

---

## Minimize clock period (I)

- Fast algorithm for solving the LP:
  - Use binary search method for finding the minimum clock period.
  - In each iteration, Bellman-Ford algorithm is called to detect if the timing constraint graph contains negative weighted edge cycle.

- Note: Originally Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find a shortest-path of a graph.

---

## Minimize clock period (II)

- When the optimal clock period is solved, the corresponding skew schedule is obtained simultaneously.

- However, many skew values are on the bounds of feasible range.

---

## Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling

- When process variations increase more and more, timing-failure-induced yield loss becomes a significant problem.

- Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling becomes important.

- Primary goal of this scheduling is to minimize the yield loss instead of minimizing the clock period.

---

## Timing Yield Definition

- The circuit is called functionally correct if all the setup time and hold time constraints are satisfied under a group of determinate process parameters.

- Timing Yield = (functional correct times) / sample number * 100%

---

## Primitive solution (1)

- Preallocate timing margins (usually equivalent to maximum timing uncertainty) at both ends of the FSRs (Feasible Skew Region).
  $$l_{ij}  \leq s_{ij} \leq u_{ij} \implies l_{ij} + \Delta d \leq s_{ij}  \leq u_{ij} - \Delta d$$

- Then perform clock period optimization.

---

## Problems with this method

- The maximum timing uncertainty is too pessimistic. Lose some performance;

- $\Delta d$ is fixed; it does not consider data path delay differences between cycle edges.

---

## Primitive solution (2)

- Formulate as LCES (Least Center Error Square) problem
  - A simple observation suggests that, to maximize slack, skew values should be chosen as close as possible to the middle points of their FSRs.

  $$l_{ij} + lm_k (u_{ij} - l_{ij}) \leq s_{ij}  \leq u_{ij} - um_k (u_{ij} - l_{ij})$$

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{minimize}   & \sum_k (0.5 - \min(lm_k, um_k) )^2 \\
    \text{subject to} & 0 \leq lm_k \leq 0.5 \\
    & 0 \leq um_k \leq 0.5
  \end{array}$$

- Quadratic Programming method
  - (I. S. Kourtev and E. G. Fredman, "Clock skew scheduling for improved reliability via quadratic programming", ICCAD'99)

Shortcoming: might reduce some slacks to be zero to minimum total CES. This is not optimal for yield.

## Primitive solution (3)

- Incremental Slack Distribution
  - (Xinjie Wei, Yici CAI and Xianlong Hong, "Clock skew scheduling under process variations", ISQED'06)

- Advantage: check all skew constraints

- Disadvantage: didn't take the path delay difference into consideration

---

## Minimum Mean Cycle Based

- **Even**: solve the slack optimization problem using a minimum mean cycle formulation.

- **Prop**: distribute slack along the most timing-critical cycle proportional to path delays

- **fp-Prop**: use sensitizable-critical-path search algorithm for clock skew scheduling.

---

## Slack Maximization (EVEN)

- Slack Maximization Scheduling
  $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize}   & t \\
      \text{subject to} & T_i - T_j \leq \mu_{ij} - t
  \end{array}$$

- Equivalent to the so-called minimum mean cycle problem (MMC), where:
   $$t^* = \frac{1}{|C|} \sum\limits_{(i,j)\in C} \mu_{ij} $$
   $C$: critical cycle (first negative cycle)

- Can be solved efficiently by the above method.

---

## Even: iterative slack optimization

- Identify the circuit's most timing-critical cycle,

- Distribute the slack along the cycle,

- Freeze the clock skews on the cycle, and

- Repeat the process iteratively.

## Problems with Even

- Assume all variances are the same.
- However, the timing uncertainty of a long combinational path is usually larger than that of a shorter path.
- Therefore, the even slack distribution along timing-critical cycles performed by **Even** is not optimal for yield if data path delays along the cycles are not the same.

---

## Prop: Based on Gaussian model (I)

- Assuming there are $n$ gates with delay $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ in a path, then this path delay is $N(n\mu,n\sigma^2)$
- Distribute slack along the most timing-critical cycle, according to the square root of each edge's path delays (???).
- To achieve this, update the weights of s-edges and h-edges:
  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  CP - (D_{ij} + \alpha \sqrt{D_{ij}} \sigma) - T_{\mathrm{setup}} \\
  -T_{\mathrm{hold}} - (d_{ij} - \alpha \sqrt{d_{ij}} \sigma)
  \end{array}$$
  where $\alpha$ ensures a minimum timing margin for each timing constraint.

---

## Prop: Based on Gaussian model (II)

- Given a specific clock period CP, we gradually increase $\alpha$ and use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect whether CP is still feasible.
- After finding the maximum $\alpha$, the edges along the most timing-critical cycle will have slacks equal to the preallocated timing margins.
- Many edges in a circuit have sufficiently large slack. Therefore, we can perform proportional slack distribution only for the most timing-critical cycle. Assign the rest of skews using **Even**.

---

## Problems with Prop

- Assume all gate delay has the same distribution.
- Not justify using the square root of path delay for timing margin.

---

## fp-Prop (I)

- False path

![img](lec05.files/fig18.png)

---

## fp-Prop (II)

- If we do not consider false path, some non timing-critical cycles become timing-critical. Then, more slacks are distributed to these cycles, but the slacks in actually timing-critical cycles are not sufficient. As a result, the overall timing yield decreases.

---

## Problems with fp-Prop

- Same problems as Prop

---

## Experimental results

![img](lec05.files/fig20.png)\

---

## Statistical Method

- Setup time constraint

  $$T_{skew}(i,f) \le T_{CP} - \tilde{D}_{if} - T_{setup}$$

- Hold time constraint

  $$T_{skew}(i,f) \ge T_{hold} - \tilde{d}_{if}$$

  where $\tilde{D}_{if}$_ and $\tilde{d}_{if}$ are randon variable
  under process variations.

---

## Statistical TC Graph

- After SSTA, edge weight is represented as a pair of value (mean, variance).

.col-7[

  ![img](lec05.files/tcgraph9.svg)

]

---

## Most Critical Cycle

- Traditional criteria: minimum mean cycle
  $$\min_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{\sum_{e\in C} w(e) }{|C|}$$

- New criteria:
  $$\min_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{\sum_{e\in C} \mu(e) }{ \sum_{e\in C} \sigma(e)}$$

  (We show the correctness later)

---

## Slack Maximization (C-PROP)

- Slack Maximization Scheduling
  $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize}   & t \\
      \text{subject to} & T_i - T_j \leq \mu_{ij} - \sigma_{ij} t
  \end{array}$$
- Equivalent to the *minimum cost-to-time ratio* problem (MMC), where:
  - $t^* = \sum_{(i,j)\in C} \mu_{ij} / \sum_{(i,j)\in C} \sigma_{ij}$
  - $C$: critical cycle (first negative cycle)

---

## Probability Observation

- Prob(timing failure) turns out to be an Error function that solely depends on this ratio. Therefore, it is justified to use this ratio as critical criteria.

---

## Whole flow

- After determining the clock arrival time at each vertex in the most critical cycle, the cycle is replaced with a super vertex $v'$.

- In-edge $e_{u,v}$_ from outside vertex $u$ to cycle member $v$ is replaced by an in-edge $e_{u,v'}$_ with weight mean $u(e_{u,v})-T_v$.

- Out-edge $e_{v,u}$_ is replaced by out-edge $e_{v',u}$_ with weight mean $u(e_{v,u})+T_v$. However, the variance of the edge weight is not changed. And parallel edges can be remained.

- Repeat the process iteratively until the graph is reduced to a single super vertex or the edges number is zero.

---

## Data structure

![](lec05.files/hierachy.svg)

Final result:
   $T_1=T_1+T_{s_1}+T_{s_3}$

---

## Advantages of This Method

- Justified by probability observation.
- Fast algorithm exists for minimum cost-to-time ratio problem.
- Reduce to Even when all variances are equal.
- When a variance tends to zero, it makes sense that only minimal slack is assigned to this variable, and hence others can be assigned more.
