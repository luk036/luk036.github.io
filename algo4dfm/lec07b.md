ðŸ“– Introduction
============



Overview
--------

-   Network flow problems can be solved efficiently and have a wide range of applications.

-   Unfortunately, some problems may have other additional constraints that make them impossible to solve with current network flow techniques.

-   In addition, in some problems, the objective function is quasi-convex rather than convex.

-   In this lecture, we will investigate some problems that can still be solved by network flow techniques with the help of convex optimization.




Parametric Potential Problems
=============================



Parametric potential problems
-----------------------------

Consider: $$
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{maximize} & g(\beta), \\
        \text{subject to} & y \leq d(\beta), \\
                             & A u = y,
    \end{array}
$$

where $g(\beta)$ and $d(\beta)$ are concave.

**Note**: the parametric flow problems can be defined in a similar way.



Network flow says:
------------------

-   For fixed $\beta$, the problem is feasible precisely when there exists no negative cycle

-   Negative cycle detection can be done efficiently using the Bellman-Ford-like methods

-   If a negative cycle $C$ is found, then $\sum_{(i,j)\in C} d_{ij}(\beta) < 0$



Convex Optimization says:
-------------------------

-   If both sub-gradients of $g(\beta)$ and $d(\beta)$ are known, then the *bisection method* can be used for solving the problem efficiently.

-   Also, for multi-parameter problems, the *ellipsoid method* can be used.



Quasi-convex Minimization
-------------------------

Consider: $$
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{maximize}      & f(\beta), \\
        \text{subject to}    & y \leq d(\beta), \\
                             & A u = y,
    \end{array}
$$

where $f(\beta)$ is *quasi-convex* and $d(\beta)$ are concave.



Example of Quasi-Convex Functions
---------------------------------

-   $\sqrt{|y|}$ is quasi-convex on $\mathbb{R}$

-   $\log(y)$ is quasi-linear on $\mathbb{R}_{++}$

-   $f(x, y) = x y$ is quasi-concave on $\mathbb{R}_{++}^2$

-   Linear-fractional function:

    -   $f(x)$ = $(a^\mathsf{T} x + b)/(c^\mathsf{T} x + d)$

    -   dom $f$ = $\{x \,|\, c^\mathsf{T} x + d > 0 \}$

-   Distance ratio function:

    -   $f(x)$ = $\| x - a\|_2 / \| x - b \|_2$

    -   dom $f$ = $\{x \,|\, \| x - a\|_2 \le \| x - b \|_2 \}$



Convex Optimization says:
-------------------------

If $f$ is quasi-convex, there exists a family of functions $\phi_t$ such that:

-   $\phi_t(\beta)$ is convex w.r.t. $\beta$ for fixed $t$

-   $\phi_t(\beta)$ is non-increasing w.r.t. $t$ for fixed $\beta$

-   $t$-sublevel set of $f$ is $0$-sublevel set of $\phi_t$, i.e., $f(\beta) \le t$ iff $\phi_t(\beta) \le 0$

For example:

-   $f(\beta) = p(\beta)/q(\beta)$ with $p$ convex, $q$ concave $p(\beta) \ge 0$, $q(\beta) > 0$ on domÂ $f$,

-   can take $\phi_t(\beta)$ = $p(\beta) - t \cdot q(\beta)$



Convex Optimization says:
-------------------------

Consider a convex feasibility problem: $$
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{find}      & f(\beta), \\
        \text{s. t.}     & \phi_t(\beta) \le 0, \\
                         & y \leq d(\beta),  A u = y,
    \end{array}
$$

-   If feasible, we conclude that $t \ge p^*$;

-   If infeasible, $t < p^*$.

Binary search on $t$ can be used for obtaining $p^*$.



Quasi-convex Network Problem
----------------------------

-   Again, the feasibility problemÂ ([eq:quasi]) can be solved efficiently by the bisection method or the ellipsoid method, together with the negatie cycle detection technique.

-   Any EDA's applications ???



Monotonic Minimization
----------------------

-   Consider the following problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{minimize}      & \max_{ij} f_{ij}(y_{ij}), \\
      \text{subject to}    & A u = y,
    \end{array}$$

    where $f_{ij}(y_{ij})$ is non-decreasing.

-   The problem can be recast as: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize} & \beta, \\
      \text{subject to} & y \leq f^{-1}(\beta), \\
      & A u = y,
    \end{array}$$

    where $f^{-1}(\beta)$ is non-deceasing w.r.t. $\beta$.



E.g. Yield-driven Optimization
------------------------------

-   Consider the following problem:

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize} & \min_{ij} \Pr(y_{ij} \leq \tilde{d}_{ij}) \\
      \text{subject to} & A u = y,
    \end{array}$$

    where $\tilde{d}_{ij}$ is a random variables.

-   Equivalent to the problem:

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize} & \beta, \\
      \text{subject to} & \beta \leq \Pr(y_{ij} \leq \tilde{d}_{ij}), \\
      & A u = y,
    \end{array}$$

    where $f_{ij}^{-1}(\beta)$ is non-deceasing w.r.t. $\beta$.



E.g. Yield-driven Optimization (II)
------------------------------

-   Let $F(x)$ is the cdf of $\tilde{d}$.

-   Then: $$\begin{array}{lll}
      & & \beta \leq \Pr(y_{ij} \leq \tilde{d}_{ij}) \leq t \\
      & \Rightarrow & \beta \leq 1 - F_{ij}(y_{ij}) \\
      & \Rightarrow & y_{ij} \leq F_{ij}^{-1}(1 - \beta)
      \end{array}$$

-   The problem becomes:

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize} & \beta, \\
      \text{subject to} & y_{ij} \leq F_{ij}^{-1}(1 - \beta), \\
      & A u = y,
    \end{array}$$



Network flow says
------------------

-   Monotonic problem can be solved efficiently 
    using cycle-cancelling methods such as Howard's algorithm.




Min-cost flow problems
======================



Min-Cost Flow Problem (linear)
------------------------------

Consider:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
  \text{min} & d^\mathsf{T} x + p \\
  \text{s. t.} & c^- \leq x \leq c^+, \\
    & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
\end{array}$$

-   some $c^+$ could be $+\infty$ some $c^-$ could be $-\infty$.
-   $A^\mathsf{T}$ is the incidence matrix of a network $G$.



Conventional Algorithms
-----------------------

-   Augmented-path based:
    -   Start with an infeasible solution
    -   Inject minimal flow into the augmented path while maintaining infeasibility in each iteration
    -   Stop when there is no flow to inject into the path.
-   Cycle cancelling based:
    -   Start with a feasible solution $x_0$
    -   find a better sol'n $x_1 = x_0 + \alpha \triangle x$, where
        $\alpha$ is positive and $\triangle x$ is a negative cycle indicator.



General Descent Method
----------------------

1.  **Input**: a starting $x \in$ dom $f$
2.  **Output**: $x^*$
3.  **repeat**
    1.  Determine a descent direction $p$.
    2.  Line search. Choose a step size $\alpha > 0$.
    3.  Update. $x := x + \alpha p$
4.  **until** a stopping criterion is satisfied.



Some Common Descent Directions
------------------------------

-   For convex problems, the search direction must satisfy $\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T} p < 0$.
-   Gradient descent:
    -   $p = -\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T}$
-   Steepest descent:
    -   $\triangle x^{nsd}$ = argmin$\{\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T} v \mid \|v\|=1 \}$.
    -   $\triangle x^{sd}$ = $\|\nabla f(x)\| \triangle x^{nsd}$ (un-normalized)
-   Newton's method:
    -   $p = -\nabla^2 f(x)^{-1} \nabla f(x)$



Network flow says (II)
------------------

-   Here, there is a better way to choose $p$!
-   Let $x := x + \alpha p$, then we have: $$\begin{array}{lll}
      \text{min}   & d^\mathsf{T} x_0 + \alpha d^\mathsf{T} p  & \Rightarrow d^\mathsf{T} < 0 \\
      \text{s. t.} & -x_0 \leq \alpha p \leq c-x_0 & \Rightarrow \text{residual graph} \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} p = 0 & \Rightarrow p \text{ is a cycle!}
    \end{array}$$
-   In other words, choose $p$ to be a negative cycle with cost $d$!
    -   Simple negative cycle, or
    -   Minimum mean cycle



Network flow says (III)
------------------

-   Step size is limited by the capacity constraints:
    -   $\alpha_1 = \min_{ij} \{c^+ - x_0\}$, for $\triangle x_{ij} > 0$
    -   $\alpha_2 = \min_{ij} \{x_0 - c^-\}$, for $\triangle x_{ij} < 0$
    -   $\alpha_\mathrm{lin}$ = min$\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2\}$
-   If $\alpha_\mathrm{lin} = +\infty$, the problem is unbounded.



Network flow says (IV)
------------------

-   An initial feasible solution can be obtained by a similar construction of the residual graph and cost vector.
-   The LEMON package implements this cycle cancelling algorithm.



Min-Cost Flow Convex Problem
----------------------------

-   Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & f(x) \\
      \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
       & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$



Common Types of Line Search
------------------------

-   Exact line search: $t$ = argmin$_{t>0} f(x + t\triangle x)$
-   Backtracking line search (with parameters $\alpha \in (0,1/2), \beta \in (0,1)$)
    -   starting from $t = 1$, repeat $t := \beta t$ until 
        $$f(x + t\triangle x) < f(x) + \alpha t \nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T} \triangle x$$
    -   graphical interpretation: backtrack until $t \leq t_0$



Network flow says (V)
------------------

-   The step size is further limited by the following:
    -   $\alpha_\mathrm{cvx} = \min\{\alpha_\mathrm{lin}, t\}$
-   In each iteration, choose $\triangle x$ as a negative cycle of $G_x$,
    with cost $\nabla f(x)$ such that $\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T} \triangle x < 0$



Quasi-convex Minimization (new)
-------------------------------

-   Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & f(x) \\
      \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

-   The problem can be recast as: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & t \\
      \text{s. t.} & f(x) \leq t, \\
      & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$



Convex Optimization says (II)
-------------------------

-   Consider a convex feasibility problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{find} & x \\
      \text{s. t.} & \phi_t(x) \leq 0, \\
      & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$
    -   If feasible, we conclude that $t \ge p^*$;
    -   If infeasible, $t < p^*$.
-   Binary search on $t$ can be used for obtaining $p^*$.



Network flow says (VI)
------------------

-   Choose $\triangle x$ as a negative cycle of $G_x$ with cost $\nabla \phi_t(x)$
-   If no negative cycle is found, and $\phi_t(x) > 0$, we conclude that the problem is infeasible.
-   Iterate until $x$ becomes feasible, i.e. $\phi_t(x) \leq 0$.



E.g. Linear-Fractional Cost
---------------------------

-   Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & (e^\mathsf{T} x + f) / (g^\mathsf{T} x + h) \\
      \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

-   The problem can be recast as: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & t \\
      \text{s. t.} & (e^\mathsf{T} x + f) - t(g^\mathsf{T} x + h) \leq 0 \\
      & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$



Convex Optimization says (III)
-------------------------

-   Consider a convex feasibility problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{find}  & x \\
      \text{s. t.} & (e - t\cdot g)^\mathsf{T} x + (f - t\cdot h) \leq 0, \\
                   & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
                   & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$
    -   If feasible, we conclude that $t \ge p^*$;
    -   If infeasible, $t < p^*$.
-   Binary search on $t$ can be used for obtaining $p^*$.



Network flow says (VII)
------------------

-   Choose $\triangle x$ to be a negative cycle of $G_x$ with cost $(e - t\cdot g)$, i.e. $(e - t\cdot g)^\mathsf{T}\triangle x < 0$
-   If no negative cycle is found, and $(e - t\cdot g)^\mathsf{T} x_0 + (f - t\cdot h) > 0$, we conclude that the problem is infeasible.
-   Iterate until $(e - t\cdot g)^\mathsf{T} x_0 + (f - t\cdot h) \leq 0$.



E.g. Statistical Optimization
-----------------------------

-   Consider the quasi-convex problem:

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & \Pr(\mathbf{d}^\mathsf{T} x > \alpha) \\
      \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

    -   $\mathbf{d}$ is random vector with mean $d$ and covariance
        $\Sigma$.
    -   Hence, $\mathbf{d}^\mathsf{T} x$ is a random variable with mean
        $d^\mathsf{T} x$ and variance $x^\mathsf{T} \Sigma x$.



Statistical Optimization
------------------------

-   The problem can be recast as: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & t \\
      \text{s. t.} & \Pr(\mathbf{d}^\mathsf{T} x > \alpha) \leq t \\
      & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

ðŸ‘‰ Note: $$\begin{array}{lll}
      & & \Pr(\mathbf{d}^\mathsf{T} x > \alpha) \leq t \\
      & \Rightarrow & d^\mathsf{T} x  + F^{-1}(1-t) \| \Sigma^{1/2} x \|_2 \leq \alpha
    \end{array}$$ (convex quadratic constraint w.r.t $x$)



Recall...
---------

Recall that the gradient of $d^\mathsf{T} x + F^{-1}(1-t) \| \Sigma^{1/2} x \|_2$ is $d + F^{-1}(1-t) (\| \Sigma^{1/2} x \|_2)^{-1} \Sigma x$.



Problem w/ additional Constraints (new)
---------------------------------------

-   Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
              \text{min} & f(x) \\
              \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
                           & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0 \\
                           & \color{green}{s^\mathsf{T} x \leq \gamma}
    \end{array}$$



E.g. Yield-driven Delay Padding
-------------------------------

-   Consider the following problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize} & \gamma\,\beta - c^\mathsf{T} p, \\
      \text{subject to} & \beta \leq \Pr(y_{ij} \leq \mathbf{d}_{ij} + p_{ij}), \\
       & A u = y, \; p \geq 0
    \end{array}$$

    -   $p$: delay padding
    -   $\gamma$: weight (determined by a trade-off curve of yield and buffer cost)
    -   $\mathbf{d}_{ij}$: Gaussian random variable with mean $d_{ij}$ and variance $s_{ij}$.



E.g. Yield-driven Delay Padding (II)
-------------------------------

.pull-left[

-   The problem is equivalent to: $$\begin{array}{ll}
       \text{max} & {\color{green}\gamma\,\beta} - c^\mathsf{T} p, \\
       \text{s.t.} & y \leq d {\color{green}- \beta s} + p, \\
          & A u = y, p \geq 0
    \end{array}$$

]

.pull-right[

-   or its dual: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & d^\mathsf{T} x  \\
      \text{s.t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
          & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0 \\
          & {\color{green}s^\mathsf{T} x \leq \gamma}
    \end{array}$$

]



Recall ...
----------

-   Yield drive CSS: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{max} & \beta, \\
      \text{s.t.} & y \leq d - \beta s, \\
      & A u = y,
    \end{array}$$

-   Delay padding $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{max} & -c^\mathsf{T} p, \\
      \text{s.t.} & y \leq d + p, \\
      & A u = y, \; p \geq 0
    \end{array}$$



Considering Barrier Method
--------------------------

-   Approximation via logarithmic barrier:

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min} & f(x) + (1/t) \phi(x)\\
      \text{s.t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} x = b, \; b(V)=0 \\
    \end{array}$$

    -   where $\phi(x) = -\log (\gamma - s^\mathsf{T} x)$
    -   Approximation improves as $t \rightarrow \infty$
    -   Here, $\nabla \phi(x) = s / (\gamma - s^\mathsf{T} x)$



Barrier Method
--------------

-   **Input**: a feasible $x$, $t := t^{(0)}$, $\mu > 1$, tolerance $\varepsilon > 0$
-   **Output**: $x^*$
-   **repeat**
    1.  Centering step. Compute $x^*(t)$ by minimizing $t\,f + \phi$
    2.  Update $x := x^*(t)$.
    3.  Increase $t$. $t := \mu t$
-   **until** $1/t < \varepsilon$.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Centering is usually done by Newton's method in general.



Network flow says (VIII)
------------------

In the centering step, instead of using the Newton descent direction, we can replace it with a negative cycle on the residual graph.



# Useful Skew Design Flow



## Useful Skew Design: Why vs.Â Why Not {#sec:first}

### Why not

Some common challenges when implementing useful skew design include:

- need more engineer training
- difficulty in building a balanced clock-tree
- uncertainty in how to handle process variation and multi-corner multi-mode issues
  ..., etc.

### Why

If these challenges are overcome and useful skew design is implemented correctly,

- it can lead to less time spent on timing issues 
- get better chip performance or yield



## Clock Arrival Time vs.Â Clock Skew

- Clock signal runs periodically.

- Thus, absolute clock arrival time $u_i$ is not so important.

- Instead, the skew $y_{ij} = u_i - u_j$ is more important in this
  scenario.



## Useful Skew Design vs.Â Zero-Skew Design

- "Critical cycle" instead of "critical path".
- "Negative cycle" instead of "negative slack".
- If there is a negative cycle, it means that there is no positive
  slack solution no matter how to schedule.
- Others are pretty much the same.
- Same design principle:
  - Always tackle the most critical one first!



## Linear Programming vs.Â Network Flow Formulation

- Linear programming formulation
  - can handle more complex constraints
- Network flow formulation
  - usually more efficient
  - return the most critical cycle as a bonus
  - can handle quantized buffer delay (???)
- Anyway, timing analysis is much more time-consuming than the
  optimization solving.



## Target Skew vs.Â Actual Skew

Don't mess up these two concepts:

- Target skew:
  - the skew we want to achieve in the scheduling stage.
  - Usually deterministic (we schedule a meeting at 10:00, rather
    than 10:00 $\pm$ 34 minutes, right?)
- Actual skew
  - the skew that the clock tree actually generates.
  - Can be formulated as a random variable.



## A Simple Case

To warm up, let us start with a simple case:

- Assume equal path delay variations.
- Single-corner.
- Before a clock tree is built.
- No adjustable delay buffer (ADB).



## Network

### Definition (Network)

A _network_ is a collection of finite-dimensional vector spaces of
_nodes_ and _edges_/_arcs_:

- $V = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_N \}$, where $|V| = N$
- $E = \{e_1, e_2, e_3, \cdots, e_M \}$ where $|E| = M$

which satisfies 2 requirements:

1.  The boundary of each edge is comprised of the union of nodes
2.  The intersection of any edges is either empty or a boundary node of
    both edges.



## Example

\begin{figure}[hp]
\centering
\input{lec07.files/network.tikz}
\caption{A network}%
\label{fig:network}
\end{figure}



## Orientation

### Definition (Orientation)

An _orientation_ of an edge is an ordering of its boundary node
$(s, t)$, where

- $s$ is called a source/initial node
- $t$ is called a target/terminal node

### Definition (Coherent)

Two orientations to be the same is called _coherent_



## Node-edge Incidence Matrix

### Definition (Incidence Matrix)

A $N \times M$ matrix $A^\mathsf{T}$ is a node-edge incidence matrix
with entries: $$A(i,j) = \begin{cases}
  +1 & \text{if $e_i$ is coherent with $v_j$}, \\  
  -1 & \text{if $e_i$ is not coherent with $v_j$}, \\  
   0 & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}$$

### Example (II)

$A^\mathsf{T} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$



## Timing Constraint

- Setup time constraint
  $$y_\text{skew}(i,f) \le T_\text{CP} - D_{if} - T_\text{setup} = u_{if}$$
  While this constraint destroyed, cycle time violation (zero
  clocking) occurs.
- Hold time constraint
  $$y_\text{skew}(i,f) \ge T_\text{hold} - d_{if} = l_{if}$$ While
  this constraint destroyed, race condition (double clocking) occurs.



## Timing Constraint Graph

- Create a graph (network) by
  - replacing the hold time constraint with an _h-edge_ with cost
    $-(T_\text{hold} - d_{ij})$ from $\text{FF}_i$ to $\text{FF}_j$,
    and
  - replacing the setup time constraint with an s-edge with cost
    $T_\text{CP} - D_{ij} - T_\text{setup}$ from $\text{FF}_j$ to
    $\text{FF}_i$.
- Two sets of constraints stemming from clock skew definition:
  - The sum of skews for paths having the same starting and ending
    flip-flop to be the same;
  - The sum of clock skews of all cycles to be zero



## Timing Constraint Graph (TCG)

\end{figure}

# First Thing First



## Meet all timing constraints

- Find $y$ in $\{y \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid y \leq d, A\,u = y\}$
- How to solve:
  1.  Find a negative cycle, fix it.
  2.  Iterate until no negative cycle is found.
- Bellman-Ford-like algorithm (and its variants are publicly
  available):
  - Strongly suggest "Lazy Evaluation":
    - Don't do full timing analysis on the whole timing graph at
      the beginning!
    - Instead, perform timing analysis only when the algorithm
      needs.
  - Stop immediately whenever a negative cycle is detected.



## Delay Padding (DP)

- Delay padding is a technique that fixes the timing issue by
  intentionally **solely** "increasing" delays.
- Usually formulated as:
  - Find $p, y$ in
    $\{p, y \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid y \leq d + p, A\,u = y, p \geq 0\}$
- If the objective is to minimize the sum of $p$, then the problem is
  the dual of the standard _min-cost flow_ problem, which can be
  solved efficiently by the _network simplex_ algorithm (publicly
  available).
- Beautiful right?



## Delay Padding (II)

- No, the above formulation is impractical.
- In modern design, "inserting" a delay may mean swapping a faster
  cell with a slower cell from the cell library. Thus, no need to
  minimize the sum of $p$.
- More importantly, it may not be possible to find a position to
  insert delay for some delay paths.
- Some papers consider only allowing insert delays to the max-delay
  path only. Some papers consider only allowing insert delays to both
  the max- and min-delay paths together only. None of them are
  perfect.



## Delay Padding (III)

- My suggestion. Instead of calculating the necessary $p's$ and then
  look for the suitable position to insert, it is easier (and more
  flexible) to determine the position first and then calculate the
  suitable values.
- It can be achieved by modifying the timing graph and solve a
  feasibility problem. Easy enough!
- Quantized delay can be handled too (???).



## Four possible ways to insert delay

}
\subfigure[$p_s \geq p_h$]{
\input{lec07.files/setup_greater.tikz}
}

\end{figure}



## Delay Padding (cont'd)

- If there exists a negative cycle in the modified timing graph, it
  implies that the timing problem cannot be fixed by simply the delay
  padding technique.
  - Then, try decrease $D_{ij}$, or increase $T_\text{CP}$
- Be aware of the min-delay path is still the min-delay path after a
  certain amount of delay is inserted (how???).

# Variation Issue



## Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling

- Assume all timing issues are fixed.
- Now, how to schedule the arrival times to maximize yield?
- According to the critical-first principle, we seek for the most
  critical cycle first.
- The problem can be formulated as:
  - $\max\{\beta \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \leq d - \beta, A\,u = y\}$.
- It is equivalent to the _minimum mean cycle_ problem, which can be
  solved efficiently by for example _Howard's algorithm_ (publicly
  available).



## Minimum Balancing Algorithm

- Then we evenly distribute the slack on this cycle.
- To continue the next most critical cycle, we contract the first one
  into a "super vertex" and repeat the process.
- The process stops when the timing graph remains only a single
  vertex.
- The overall method is known as _minimum balancing_ (MB) algorithm in
  the literature.



## Example: Most timing-critical cycle

The most vulnerable timing constraint

## Example: Distribute the slack

- Distribute the slack evenly along the most timing-critical cycle.

## Example: Distribute the slack (cont'd)

- To determine the optimal slacks and skews for the rest of the graph,
  we replace the critical cycle with a super vertex.

## Final result


- Skew$_{12}$ = 0.75
- Skew$_{23}$ = -0.25
- Skew$_{31}$ = -0.5

- Slack$_{12}$ = 1.75
- Slack$_{23}$ = 1.75
- Slack$_{31}$ = 1

  where Slack$_{ij}$ = CP - D$_{ij}$ - T$_\text{setup}$ - Skew$_{ij}$

## What the MB algorithm really give us?

- The MB algorithm not only give us the scheduling solution, but also
  a tree-topology that represents the order of "criticality"!

\begin{figure}

\input{lec05.files/hierachy.tikz}
\end{figure}



## Clock-tree Synthesis and Placement

- I strongly suggest that the topology of the clock-tree precisely
  follows the order of "criticality"!
  - since the lower branch of clock-tree has smaller skew variation.
- I also suggest that the placer should follow the topology of the
  clock-tree:
  - Physically place the registers of the same branch together.
  - The locality implies stronger correlation of variations and
    implies even smaller skew variation due to the cancellation
    effect.
  - Note that the current SSTA does not provide the correlation
    information, so this is the best you can do!



## Second Example: Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling

- Now assume that SSTA (or STA+OCV, POCV, AOCV) is performed.
- Let ($\bar{d}$, $s$) be the (mean, variance) of $\mathbf{d}$
- The most critical cycle can be obtained by solving:
  - $\max\{\beta \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \leq \bar{d} - \beta s, A\,u = y\}$
- It is equivalent to the minimum cost-to-time ratio cycle problem,
  which can be solved efficiently by for example Howard's algorithm
  (publicly available).
- Gaussian distribution is assumed. For arbitrary distribution, see my
  DAC'08 paper.



## What About the Correlation?

- In the above formulation, we minimum the maximum possibility of
  timing violation of each _individual_ timing constraint. So only
  individual delay distribution is needed.
- Yes, the objective function is not the true timing-yield. But it is
  reasonable, easy to solve, and is the best you can do so far.

# Multi-Corner Issue



## Meet all timing constraints in Multi-Corner

- Assume no Adjustable Delay Buffer (ADB)
- Find $y$ in
  $\{y \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid y \leq d^{(k)}, A\,u = y, \forall k\in[1..K]\}$
- Equivalent to finding $y$ in
  $\{y \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid y \leq \min_k\{ d^{(k)}\}, A\,u = y \}$
- Feasibility problem
- How to solve:
  1.  Find a negative cycle, fix it.
  2.  Iterate until no negative cycle is found.
- Better avoid fixing the timing issue corner-by-corner. Inducing
  ping-pong effect.



## Delay padding (DP) in Multi-Corner

- The problem CANNOT be formulated as a network flow problem. But
  still you can solve it by a linear programming formulation.
- Or, decompose the problem into sub-problems for each corner.
- Again use the modified timing graph technique.
- Then, $y$'s are shared variables of sub-problems.
- If we solve each sub-problem individually, the solution will not
  agree with each other. Induce _ping-pong effect_.
- Need something to drive the agreement.



## Delay Padding (DP) in Multi-Corner (cont'd)

- Follow the idea of _dual decomposition_: If a solution is above the
  average. then introduce a punishment cost. If a solution is below
  the average, then introduce a rewarding cost.
- Then, each subproblem is a min-cost potential problem, which can be
  solved efficiently.
- If some subproblems do not have feasible solutions, it implies that
  the problem cannot be fixed by simply delay padding.
- The process repeats until all solutions converge. If not, it implies
  that the problem cannot be fixed by simply delay padding.



## Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling

- $\max\{\beta \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \leq d^{(k)} - \beta s, A\,u = y, \forall k\in[1..K]\}$
- More or less the same as in Single Corner.

# Clock-Tree Issue



## Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

- Construct merging location
  - DME algorithm, Elmore delay, buffer insertion
- Some research on _bounded-skew DME algorithm_. But the algorithm is
  too complicated in my opinion.
- If the previous stage is over-optimized, the clock tree is hard to
  implement. If it happens, some budgeting techniques should be
  invoked (engineering issue)
- After a clock tree is constructed, more detailed timing (rather than
  Elmore delay) can be obtained via timing analysis.



## Co-optimization Issue

- After a clock tree is built, we have a clearer picture.
- Should I perform the re-scheduling? And how?
- Some papers suggest adding a factor to the timing constraint, say:
  $$1.2 u_i - 0.8 u_j \leq w_{ij}$$.
- Then the formulation is not a kind of network-flow, but may still be
  solvable by linear programming.
- Need to investigate more deeply.



# Adjustable Delay Buffer Issue



## Adjustable delay buffers in Multi-Mode

- Assume adjustable delay buffers are added solely to the clock tree
- Hence, each mode can have a different set of arrival times.
- Easier for clock skew scheduling, harder for clock-tree synthesis.



## Meet timing constraint in Multi-Mode:

- find $y^{(m)}$ in
  $\{y^{(m)} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid y^{(m)} \leq d^{(m)}, A\,u^{(m)} = y^{(m)}, \forall m\in[1..M]\}$
- Can be done in parallel.
- find a negative cycle, fix it (do not need to know all $d_i^{(m)}$
  at the beginning) for every mode in parallel.



## Delay Padding (DP) in Multi-mode

- Again use a modified timing graph technique.
- NOT a network flow problem. Use LP, or
- Dual decomposition -\> min-cost potential problem for each mode
  - Only $p$'s are shared variables.
  - Initial feasible solution obtained by the single-mode method
    - A negative cycle =\> problem cannot be fixed by DP
- Not converge =\> problem cannot be fixed by DP
  - Try decrease $D_{ij}$, or increase $T_\text{CP}$



## Yield-driven Clock Skew Scheduling

- $\max\{\beta \in \mathbb{R} \mid y^{(m)} \leq d^{(m)} - \beta s, A\,u^{(m)} = y^{(m)}, \forall m\in[1..M]\}$
- Pretty much the same as Single-Mode.



## Difficulty in ADB Multi-Mode Design

- How to design the clock-tree?
- What is the order of criticality?
- How to determine the minimum range of ADB?
