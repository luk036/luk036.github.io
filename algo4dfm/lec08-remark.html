## Background

.pull-left[

- In the past, chips have continued to get smaller and smaller, and therefore consume less and less power.

- However, we are rapidly approaching the end of the road and optical lithography cannot take us to the next place we need to go.

## Process of Lithography

.pull-left[

1. Photo-resist coating (光阻涂层)

2. Illumination (光照)

3. Exposure (曝光)

4. Etching (蚀刻)

5. Impurities doping (杂质掺杂)

6. Metal connection

## Sub-wavelength Lithography

.pull-left[

- Feature size is much smaller than the lithography wavelength
  - 45nm vs. 193nm

- What you see in the mask/layout is **not** what you get on the chip:
  - Features are distored
  - Yields are declined

## What is the impact of lithography in DFM?

Lithography is an important aspect of DFM because it plays a critical role in defining the physical features of the IC. DFM techniques such as phase shifting mask and multiple patterning can help address manufacturing issues related to lithography.

One of the main impacts of lithography in DFM is that it can cause variations in the dimensions and shapes of the IC's features, which can negatively impact the performance and yield of the IC. This is because lithography is a complex process that involves the use of light to transfer a pattern from a mask to a wafer. Variations in the intensity, wavelength, and angle of the light can cause deviations in the dimensions and shapes of the features, which can lead to process-induced variation.

## Phase Conflict Graph

- Edge between two features with separation of $\leq b$ (dark field)
- Similar conflict graph for "bright field".
- Construction method: plane sweeping method + dynamic priority search tree

## Phase Assignment Problem

.pull-left[

- Instance: Graph $G = (V, E)$
- Solution: A color assignment $c: V \to [1..k]$ (here $k=2$)
- Goal: Minimize the weights of the monochromatic edges.
  (Question: How can we model the weights?)

## Phase Assignment Problem

- In general, the problem is NP-hard.
- It is solvable in polynomial time for planar graphs with $k=2$, since the problem is equivalent to the T-join problem in the dual graph [Hadlock75].
- For planar graphs with $k=2$, the problem can be solved approximately in the ratio of two using the primal-dual method.

---

## Overview of Greedy Algorithm

- Create a maximum weighted spanning tree (MST) of $G$
  (can be found in LEDA package)
- Assign colors to the nodes of the MST.
- Reinsert edges that do not conflict.
- Time complexity: $O(N \log N)$
- Can be applied to non-planar graphs.

---

## Greedy Algorithm

.pull-left[

- Step 1: Construct a maximum spanning tree $T$ of $G$ (using e.g. Kruskal's algorithm, which is available in the LEDA package).

## Other Approaches

- Reformulate the problem as a MAX-CUT problem. 
  Note that the MAX-CUT problem is approximatable within a factor of 1.1383
  using the "semi-definite programming" relaxation technique [Goemans and Williamson 93].

- Planar graph approach: Convert $G$ to a planar graph by removing the minimal edges, and then apply the methods to the resulting planar graph. 
  
  👉 Note: the optimal "planar sub-graph" problem is NP-hard.

---

## Overview of Planar Graph Approach (Hadlock's algorithm)

1. Approximate $G$ by a planar graph $G'$
2. Decompose $G'$ into its bi-connected components.
3. For each bi-connected component in $G'$,
    1. construct a planar embedding
    2. construct a dual graph $G^*$
    3. construct a complete graph $C(V, E)$, where
       - $V$ is a set of odd-degree vertices in $G^*$
       - the weight of each edge is the shortest path of two vertices
    4. find the minimum perfect matching 💯👬🏻 solution. 
       The matching edges are the conflict edges that have to be deleted.
4. Reinsert the non-conflicting edges from $G$.

- Step 1: Approximate $G$ with a planar graph $G'$
  - It is NP-hard.
  - The naive greedy algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time.
  - Any good suggestion?
