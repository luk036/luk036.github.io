## OPC and PSM

.pull-left[

- Results of OPC on PSM:
  - A = original layout
  - B = uncorrected layout
  - C = after PSM and OPC

## Phase Shifting Mask

## Phase Conflict Graph

- Edge between two features whose separation is $\leq b$ (dark field)
- Similar conflict graph for "bright field".
- Construction method: Plane sweeping method + dynamic priority search tree

## Phase Assignment Problem

.pull-left[

- Instance: Graph $G = (V, E)$
- Solution: A color assignment $c: V \to [1..k]$ ($k=2$ here)
- Goal: Minimize the weight of the monochromatic edges.
  (Question: How to model the weight?)

## Phase Assignment Problem

- In general, the problem is NP-hard.
- Polynomial time solvable for planar graphs with $k=2$, since the problem is equivalent to a T-join problem in the dual graph [Hadlock75].
- The problem can be approximated within a ratio of 2 by the primal-dual method for planar graphs with $k=2$.

---

## Overview of Greedy Algorithm

- Create a maximum weighted spanning tree (MST) of $G$
  (available in LEDA package)
- Assign colors to nodes of MST
- Reinsert edges that do not conflict.
- Time complexity: $O(N \log N)$
- Can be applied to non-planar graphs.

## Greedy Algorithm

.pull-left[

- Step 1: Construct a maximum spanning tree $T$ of $G$ (using e.g. Kruskal's algorithm, which is available in the LEDA package).

## Other Approaches

- Reformulate the problem into the MAX-CUT problem. Note
  that the MAX-CUT problem is approximable within a factor
  1.1383 [Goemans and Williamson 93] using "Semidefinite
  Programming" relaxation technique.
- Planar graph approach: Convert $G$ into a planar graph by
  removing minimal weighted edges and then apply methods to
  the resulting planar graph. Note that the optimal "planar
  sub-graph" problem is NP-hard.

## Overview of Planar Graph Approach (Hadlock's algorithm)

1. Approximate $G$ with a planar graph $G'$
2. Decompose $G'$ into its bi-connected components.
3. For each bi-connected component in $G'$,
    1. Construct a planar embedding
    2. Construct a dual graph $G^*$
    3. Construct a complete graph $C(V, E)$ where $V$ is a set of odd
       degree vertices of $G^*$ and the weight of each edge is the
       shortest path of two vertices in $G^*$
    4. Find the minimum perfect matching solution. The matching
       edges are the conflict edges that have to be deleted.
4. Reinsert edges from $G$ that do not conflict.

## Planar Graph Approach

.pull-left[

- Step1: Approximate $G$ with a planar graph $G'$
  - It is NP-hard.
  - The naive greedy algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time.
  - Any good suggestion?

## Planar Graph Approach

- Step 2: Decompose $G'$ into its bi-connected components in
  linear time (available in the LEDA package).

## Planar Graph Approach

- Step 3: For each bi-connected component in $G'$, construct a
  planar embedding in linear time (available in the LEDA package)

  ![img](lec08.files/013.jpg)

- Note that planar embedding may not be unique unless $G$ is
  tri-connected.
