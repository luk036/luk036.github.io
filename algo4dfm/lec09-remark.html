## Background

.pull-left[

- In the past, chips have continued to get smaller and smaller, and therefore consume less and less power.

- However, we are fast approaching the end of the road, where optical lithography cannot take us to the next place we need to go.

## Lithography Process

2. Illumination (光照)

3. Exposure (曝光)

## Sub-wavelength Lithography

.pull-left[

- Feature size << lithography wavelength
  - 45nm vs. 193nm

![image](lec09.media/image4.png)

]
.pull-right[

- What you see in the mask/layout is **not** what you get on the chip:
  - Features are distored
  - Yields are declined

In contrast to conventional optical lithography, which exposes the photoresist once under one mask, the mask is exposed twice by splitting it into two, each with half its feature density.

## Key technologies

- *Layout fracturing* algorithm to reduce the number of rectangles and total cut length.

- *Dynamic priority search tree* for plane sweeping.

- Graph-theoretic approach:

  - Convert the coloring problem to a T-join problem and then solve it with Hadlock's algorithm.

- Decompose the underlying conflict graph into its tri-connected components using a data structure named *SPQR-tree*.

---

## Polygon Fracturing Algorithm

- Allow minimal overlap to reduce the number of rectangles, and thus the number of conflicts.

## Conflict Detection

.pull-left70[

- Rule 1: If the distance between two rectangles is greater than $b$, then the two rectangles are *not* in conflict.

- Rule 2: Two overlaping/contacting rectangles are **NOT** conflict.

- Rule 3:

  - Definition: if a polygon is both *x-monotone* and *y-monotone*, it is said to be *rectilinearly convex*.

  - Two rectanlges $X$ and $Y$ are in conflict if their distances are $\leq b$, and there is a path from $X$ to $Y$ that reconstructs a "concave" polygon.

  - Conflicting: $(A,C)$, $(B,D)$, but not $(A,B)$, $(A,D)$ and $(B,C)$.

## Conflict Graph

  ![image](lec09.pics/conflict2.svg)

- Blue edge: positive weight (opposite color preferred)
- Green edge: negative weight (same color preferred)

---

## Formulation of the Layout Decomposition Problem

- INSTANCE: Graph $G = (V,E)$ and weight function $w:E \to Z$
- SOLUTION: Disjoint subsets of vertices $V_0$ and $V_1$ so that $V_0 \cup V_1 = V$ and $V_0 \cap V_1 = \emptyset$.
- MINIMIZE: total cost $\sum_{e \in E_c} w(e)$ where $E_c = \{(u,v) : u,v \in V_0$ or $u,v \in V_1, (u,v) \in E\}$

👉 Note: the problem is
  - Linear time solvable for bipartite graphs.
  - Polynomial time solvable for planar graphs.
  - But in general, NP-hard (even for tripartite graphs)

---

## Graph-Theoretic Approach

- Q: How to produce a high-quality result when the problem is NP-hard?

- A: Observe that $G$ is a nearly planar graph: we can use Hadlock's algorithm.

- However, the time complexity of this method is still high.

- Solution: Graph division methods.

## Connected Graph

- Recall that a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a *connected* if every pair $u,v \in V$ of vertices in $G$ is connected by a path.

- A graph can be divided into its connected components in linear time.

- Obviously, the color assignment problem can be solved independently for each connected component without affecting any QoR.

---

## Biconnected Graph

- A vertex is called a *cut-vertex* of a connected graph $G$ if removing it disconnects $G$.

- If no cut-vertex can be found in $G$, then the graph is called a biconnected graph.

- In the following example, $a$, $b$ and $c$ are cut-vertices.

  ![An example of a conflict graph with its biconnected components. Vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ are cut-vertices.](lec09.pics/biconnected.svg)

---

## Biconnected Components $G'$

- A division of $G$ into its biconnected components can be performed in linear time by identifying the cut-vertices using a simple depth-first search.

- It can easily be shown that the color assignment problem can be solved for each biconnected component separately without affecting any QoR [@chiang_fast_2005]

- Question: Is it possible to further decompose the graph?

---

## Triconnected Graph

- A pair of vertices is called a *separation pair* of $G'$ if removing the pair of vertices will disconnect $G'$.

- If no separation pair can be found in $G'$, then it is called a *triconnected graph*.

- For example below, $(a,b)$, $(g,h)$, $(c,d)$, $(c,e)$ and $(c,f)$ are separation pairs.

## SPQR-tree

  ![image](lec09.pics/spqr-tree.svg)

- A division of $G'$ into its triconnected components can be performed by identifying the separation pairs in linear time with the help of SPQR-tree [@gutwenger_linear_2001].

---

## Skeleton

- Each tree node of SPQR-tree is associated with a triconnected component of $G'$ called *skeleton*

- A skeleton represents a contraction of $G'$ based on a set of *virtual edges*.

- A skeleton was classified into four types:

  - Series (S): the skeleton is a cycle graph.

  - Parallel (P): the skeleton contains only two vertices $s$ and $t$, and $k$ parallel edges between $s$ and $t$ where $k \ge 3$.

  - Trivial (Q): the skeleton contains only two vertices $s$ and $t$, and two parallel edges between $s$ and $t$, one is a virtual edge and the other one is a real edge.

  - Rigid (R): the skeleton is a triconnected graph other than the above types.

# Divide-and-Conquer Method

---

## Divide-and-conquer method

Consists of three basic steps:

1. Divide a conflict graph into its triconnected components.

2. Conquer each triconnected components in a bottom-up manner.

3. Merge the solutions into a complete one in a top-down manner.

We calculate two possible solution for components, namely $(s,t)$ in same color and $(s,t)$ in opposite colors.

## Node Splitting

- Node splitting (additional rectangle splitting) for resolving conflicts.
- To reduce the number of "cut", we apply the node splitting after one color assignment and then perform the re-coloring.
