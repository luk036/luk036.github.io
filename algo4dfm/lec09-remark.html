## Background

.pull-left[

- In the past, chips were continuously getting smaller and smaller, and hence less power consumption.

- However, we're fast approaching the end of the road where optical lithography cannot take us where we need to go next.

## Sub-wavelength Lithography

.pull-left[

- Feature size << lithography wavelength
    - 45nm vs. 193nm

![image](lec09.media/image4.png)

]
.pull-right[

- What you see in the mask/layout is **not** what you get on the chip:
    - 图形失真
    - 成品率下降

Instead of exposing the photo-resist layer once under one mask, as in conventional optical lithography, expose it twice, by splitting the mask into two, each with features half as dense.

---

## Key Techniques

- *Layout fracturing* algorithm to reduce the number of rectangles and the total cut-length.

- *Dynamic priority search tree* for plane-sweeping.

- Graph-theoretic approach:

  - Convert the coloring problem to a T-join problem and then solve by Hadlock's algorithm.

- Decompose the underlying conflict graph into its tri-connected components using a data structure named *SPQR-tree*.

---

## Polygon Fracturing Algorithm

- Allow minimal overlapping to reduce the number of rectangles, and hence to reduce the number of conflicts.

## Conflict Detection

.pull-left70[

- Rule 1: Two rectangles are **NOT** conflict if their distance is > $b$.

- Rule 2: Two overlapped/touching rectangles are **NOT** conflict.

- Rule 3: 

   - Define: a polygon is said to be *rectilinearly convex* if it is both *x-monotone* and *y-monotone*.

   - Two rectanlges $X$ and $Y$ are in conflict if their distance is $\leq b$, and there is a path from $X$ to $Y$ that reconstructs a "concave" polygon.

   - Conflict: $(A,C)$, $(B,D)$, but not $(A,B)$, $(A,D)$ and $(B,C)$.

## Conflict Graph

  ![image](lec09.pics/conflict2.svg)

- Blue edge: positive weight (opposite color preferred)
- Green edge: negative weight (same color preferred)

---

## Layout Decomposition Problem Formulation

-   INSTANCE: Graph $G = (V,E)$ and a weight function $w:E \to Z$
-   SOLUTION: Disjoint vertex subsets $V_0$ and $V_1$ so that $V_0 \cup V_1 = V$ and $V_0 \cap V_1 = \emptyset$.
-   MINIMIZE: the total cost $\sum_{e \in E_c} w(e)$ where $E_c = \{(u,v) : u,v \in V_0$ or $u,v \in V_1, (u,v) \in E\}$

- Note: the problem is
   - Linear-time solvable for bipartite graphs.
   - Polynomial-time solvable for planar graphs.
   - But NP-hard in general (even for tripartite graphs)

---

## Graph-Theoretic Approach

- Q: How to produce a high-quality result when the problem is NP-hard?

- A: Observe that $G$ is a nearly planar graph: we can use Hadlock's algorithm.

- However, the time complexity of this method is still high.

- Solution: Graph division methods.

SPQR-Tree 
=========

---

## Connected Graph

- Recall that a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a *connected* if every pair $u,v \in V$ of vertices in $G$ is connected by a path.

- A graph can be divided into its connected components in linear time. 

- Obviously, the color assignment problem can be solved independently for each connected components without affecting any QoR.

---

## Biconnected Graph

- A vertex is called a *cut-vertex* of a connected graph $G$ if removing it will disconnect $G$.

- If no cut-vertex can be found in $G$, then the graph is called a biconnected graph.

- For example below, $a$, $b$ and $c$ are cut-vertices.

  ![An example of a conflict graph with its biconnected components. Vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ are cut-vertices.](lec09.pics/biconnected.svg)

---

## Biconnected Components $G'$

- A division of $G$ into its biconnected components can be performed in linear time by identifying the cut-vertices using a simple depth-first search. 

- It can easily be shown that the color assignment problem can be solved for each biconnected component separately without affecting any QoR [@chiang_fast_2005]

- Question: Is it possible to further decompose the graph?

---

## Triconnected Graph

- A pair of vertices is called a *separation pair* of $G'$ if removing the pair of vertices will disconnect $G'$. 

- If no separation pair can be found in $G'$, then it is called a *triconnected graph*. 

- For example below, $(a,b)$, $(g,h)$, $(c,d)$, $(c,e)$ and $(c,f)$ are separation pairs.

  ![An example of a conflict graph with its triconnected components. $\{a,b\}$, $\{c,d\}$, $\{c,e\}$, $\{c,f\}$ and $\{g,h\}$ are separation pairs.](lec09.pics/cutvertices.svg)

## SPQR-tree

  ![image](lec09.pics/spqr-tree.svg)

- A division of $G'$ into its triconnected components can be performed by identifying the separation pairs in linear time with the help of SPQR-tree [@gutwenger_linear_2001].


---

## Skeleton

- Each tree node of SPQR-tree is associated with a triconnected component of $G'$ called *skeleton* 

- A skeleton represents a contraction of $G'$ based on a set of *virtual edges*. 

- A skeleton was classified into four types:

  -   Series (S): the skeleton is a cycle graph.

  -   Parallel (P): the skeleton contains only two vertices $s$ and $t$, and $k$ parallel edges between $s$ and $t$ where $k \ge 3$.

  -   Trivial (Q): the skeleton contains only two vertices $s$ and $t$, and two parallel edges between $s$ and $t$, one is a virtual edge and the other one is a real edge.

  -   Rigid (R): the skeleton is a triconnected graph other than the above types.

Divide-and-Conquer Method
=========================

---

## Divide-and-conquer method 

Consists of three basic steps:

1.  Divide a conflict graph into its triconnected components.

2.  Conquer each triconnected components in a bottom-up manner.

3.  Merge the solutions into a complete one in a top-down manner.

We calculate two possible solution for components, namely $(s,t)$ in same color and $(s,t)$ in opposite colors.

Node Splitting 
--------------

- Node splitting (additional rectangle splitting) for resolving conflicts.
- To reduce the number of "cut", we apply the node splitting after one color assignment and then perform the re-coloring.
