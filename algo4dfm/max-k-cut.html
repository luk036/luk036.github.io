## MAX-$k$-CUT Problem

- Also known as MINIMUM EDGE DELETION $k$-PARTITION (Garey and Johnson GT32)
- INSTANCE: Graph $G=(V,E)$ and a weight function $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
- SOLUTION: An $k$-partition, i.e., a color assignment $c: V \rightarrow \{1,2,...,k\}$
- MEASURE: The sum of weights of edges with different colors.
- Bad News: APX-hard.

---

## MAX-CUT Problem ($k$ = 2)

- Approximable within 1.1383 (using Semidefinite Relaxation) \[Goemans and Williamson 93\].
- Not approximable within 1.058 \[Hastad 97\].
- Polynomial time solvable for planar graphs, since the problem is equivalent to the T-join problem in the dual graph \[Hadlock75\].
- Approximable within 9/4 for planar graphs (using primal-dual method) \[Goemans and Williamson 95\].
- Linear time solvable for bipartite graphs.
- Linear time solvable for series-parallel graphs (using SPQR-tree).

## Applications

## Overview of Planar Graph Approach (Hadlock's algorithm)

1.  Approximate $G$ by a planar graph $G'$
2.  Decompose $G'$ into its bi-connected components.
3.  For each bi-connected component in $G'$,
    1.  construct a planar embedding
    2.  construct a dual graph $G^+$
    3.  construct a complete graph $C(V, E)$, where
        -   $V$ is a set of odd-degree vertices in $G^*$
        -   the weight of each edge is the shortest path of two vertices
    4.  find the **minimum perfect matching** solution.
        The matching edges are the conflict edges that have to be deleted.
4.  Reinsert the non-conflicting edges from $G$.

## Planar Graph Approach

.pull-left[

-   Step 1: Approximate $G$ with a planar graph $G'$
    -   It is NP-hard.
    -   The naive greedy algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time.
    -   Any good suggestion?

# SPQR-Tree

## Connected Graph

- Recall that a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a *connected* if every pair of vertices $u, v$ in $G$ is connected by a path.

- A graph can be divided into its connected components in linear time.

- Clearly, the color assignment problem can be solved independently
  for each connected component without affecting any QoR.

---

## Bi-connected Graph

- A vertex is called a *cut-vertex* of a connected graph $G$ if removing it disconnects $G$.

- If no cut-vertex is found in $G$, then the graph is called a bi-connected graph.

- In the following example, $a$, $b$ and $c$ are cut-vertices.

  ![An example of a conflict graph with its bi-connected components. Vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ are cut-vertices.](lec09.pics/biconnected.svg)

---

## Bi-connected Components $G'$

- A division of $G$ into its bi-connected components can be performed in linear time by using a simple depth-first search to identify cut-vertices.

- It can be easily shown that the color assignment problem can be solved
  for each bi-connected component separately without affecting any QoR [@chiang_fast_2005]

- Question: Is it possible to further decompose the graph?

---

## Tri-connected Graph

- If removing a pair of vertices will disconnect $G'$, the pair is called a *separation pair* of $G'$.

- If no separation pair can be found in $G'$, then it is called a *tri-connected graph*.

- In the following example, $(a,b)$, $(g,h)$, $(c,d)$, $(c,e)$ and $(c,f)$ are separation pairs.

  ![An example of a conflict graph and its tri-connected components. $\{a,b\}$, $\{c,d\}$, $\{c,e\}$, $\{c,f\}$ and $\{g,h\}$ are separation pairs.](lec09.pics/cutvertices.svg)

## Tri-connected Graph Division

---

## SPQR-tree

  ![image](lec09.pics/spqr-tree.svg)

- A division of $G'$ into its tri-connected components can be performed by identifying the separation pairs in linear time with the help of SPQR-tree [@gutwenger_linear_2001].

---

## Skeleton

- Each tree node of SPQR-tree is associated with a tri-connected component of $G'$ called *skeleton*
- A skeleton represents a contraction of $G'$ based on a set of *virtual edges*.
- A skeleton was classified into four types:
  - Series (S): the skeleton is a cycle graph.
  - Parallel (P): the skeleton contains only two vertices $s$ and $t$, and $m$ parallel edges between $s$ and $t$ where $m \ge 3$.
  - Trivial (Q): the skeleton contains only two vertices $s$ and $t$,
    and two parallel edges between $s$ and $t$, one of which is virtual and the other is real.
  - Rigid (R): the skeleton is a tri-connected graph of a type other than the above.

# Divide-and-Conquer Method

---

## Divide-and-conquer method

Consists of three basic steps:

1. Divide a conflict graph into its tri-connected components.

2. Conquer each tri-connected component in a bottom-up manner.

3. Combine the solutions into a complete solution in a top-down manner.

We calculate two possible solutions for each component, namely $(s,t)$ of the same color and $(s,t)$ of the opposite color.

- Not approximable within $O(|E|)$.
- NP-hard even for tri-partite graphs and $k=3$.
- Heuristic algorithms using "pairwise coloring".
