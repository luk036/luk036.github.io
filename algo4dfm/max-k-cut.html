# üî™ MAX-k-CUT Problem: Foundations and Applications

üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ @luk036

## üìù Abstract

The MAX-k-CUT problem is a fundamental graph partitioning challenge in computational optimization. It involves dividing graph vertices into k distinct color groups to maximize the weight of edges connecting differently colored vertices.

This lecture explores the mathematical foundations, computational complexity, solution approaches, and practical applications of the MAX-k-CUT problem, with special focus on planar graph techniques and divide-and-conquer methods using SPQR-trees.

## MAX-$k$-CUT Problem

- Also known as MINIMUM EDGE DELETION $k$-PARTITION (Garey and Johnson GT32)

- INSTANCE: Graph $G=(V,E)$ and a weight function $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$

- SOLUTION: An $k$-partition, i.e., a color assignment $c: V \rightarrow \{1,2,...,k\}$

- MEASURE: The sum of weights of edges with different colors.

- Bad News: APX-hard (meaning it cannot be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time unless P=NP).

---

## MAX-CUT Problem ($k$ = 2)

- Approximable within 1.1383 (using Semidefinite Relaxation) \[Goemans and Williamson 93\].

- Not approximable within 1.058 \[Hastad 97\].

- Polynomial time solvable for planar graphs, since the problem is equivalent to the T-join problem in the dual graph \[Hadlock75\].

- Approximable within 9/4 for planar graphs (using primal-dual method) \[Goemans and Williamson 95\].

- Linear time solvable for bipartite graphs due to natural 2-coloring properties of bipartite graphs.

- Linear time solvable for series-parallel graphs (using SPQR-tree decomposition techniques).

---

## Real-World Applications

- Multiple Patterning Lithography

  In semiconductor manufacturing, MAX-k-CUT helps resolve conflicts in layout decomposition for advanced lithography processes.

- Network Design & Resource Allocation

  Optimizes network partitioning and resource distribution in telecommunications and computing systems.

- Image Segmentation

  Partitions images into meaningful regions for computer vision applications and medical imaging analysis.

- Many Others

  e.g. Via minimization in Mutli-Chip Module (MCM)

## Overview of Planar Graph Approach (Hadlock's algorithm)

1.  Decompose $G$ into its bi-connected components.
2.  For each biconnected component in $G'$,
    1.  Approximate $G'$ by a planar graph $P$
    2.  construct a planar embedding
    3.  construct a dual graph $P^+$
    4.  construct a complete graph $C(V, E)$, where
        -   $V$ is a set of odd-degree vertices in $P^*$
        -   the weight of each edge is the shortest path of two vertices
    5.  find the **minimum perfect matching** solution.
        The matching edges are the conflict edges that have to be deleted.
3.  Reinsert the non-conflicting edges from $G$.

---

## Hadlock's Algorithm

- Decompose into Components

  Break the original graph G into its bi-connected components G' using linear time algorithms (available in LEDA package)

- Approximate to Planar Graph

  Convert each compoment G' to a planar graph P (NP-hard, typically using greedy algorithms in O(n¬≤) time)

- Process Each Component

  For each component P: construct planar embedding, build dual graph P*, create complete graph of odd-degree vertices

- Find Minimum Perfect Matching

  Identify conflict edges that must be deleted, then reinsert non-conflicting edges from G

## Planar Graph Approach

-   Step 1: Decompose $G$ into its bi-connected components in

## Connected Graph

- Recall that a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a *connected* if every pair of vertices $u, v$ in $G$ is connected by a path.

- A graph can be divided into its connected components in linear time.

- Clearly, the color assignment problem can be solved independently
  for each connected component without affecting any QoR.

---

## Bi-connected Graph

- A vertex is called a *cut-vertex* of a connected graph $G$ if removing it disconnects $G$.

- If no cut-vertex is found in $G$, then the graph is called a bi-connected graph.

- In the following example, $a$, $b$ and $c$ are cut-vertices.

  ![An example of a conflict graph with its bi-connected components. Vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ are cut-vertices.](lec09.pics/biconnected.svg)

---

## Bi-connected Components $G'$

- A division of $G$ into its bi-connected components can be performed in linear time by using a simple depth-first search to identify cut-vertices.

- It can be easily shown that the color assignment problem can be solved
  for each bi-connected component separately without affecting any QoR¬†[@chiang_fast_2005]

- Question: Is it possible to further decompose the graph?

---

## Tri-connected Graph

- If removing a pair of vertices will disconnect $G'$, the pair is called a *separation pair* of $G'$.

- If no separation pair can be found in $G'$, then it is called a *tri-connected graph*.

- In the following example, $(a,b)$, $(g,h)$, $(c,d)$, $(c,e)$ and $(c,f)$ are separation pairs.

  ![An example of a conflict graph and its tri-connected components. $\{a,b\}$, $\{c,d\}$, $\{c,e\}$, $\{c,f\}$ and $\{g,h\}$ are separation pairs.](lec09.pics/cutvertices.svg)

---

## Tri-connected Graph Division

  ![image](lec09.pics/triconnected.svg)

---

## SPQR-tree

  ![image](lec09.pics/spqr-tree.svg)

- A division of $G'$ into its tri-connected components can be performed by identifying the separation pairs in linear time with the help of SPQR-tree¬†[@gutwenger_linear_2001].

---

## SPQR-Tree Decomposition

Each node in the tree represents a skeleton (a simplified version of a component) classified into one of four types:

- Series (S)

  Skeleton is a cycle graph, representing a chain of components connected in series

- Parallel (P)

  Skeleton contains two vertices with multiple (‚â•3) parallel edges between them

- Trivial (Q)

  Skeleton has two vertices with one real edge and one virtual edge

- Rigid (R)

  Skeleton is a tri-connected graph not falling into the above categories

# Divide-and-Conquer Method

---

## Divide-and-Conquer Method

- Divide

  Decompose the conflict graph into its tri-connected components using SPQR-tree. This creates a hierarchical structure of simpler subproblems.

- Conquer

  Solve each tri-connected component in a bottom-up manner, calculating two possible solutions: separation vertices (s,t) of the same color and (s,t) of opposite colors.

- Combine

  Merge the solutions in a top-down manner to construct a complete solution for the original graph, selecting optimal configurations at each step.

This approach efficiently handles different skeleton types (S, P, R) with specific strategies for each. The bottom-up phase computes optimal solutions for components, while the top-down phase ensures global consistency.

Unlike conventional optical lithography, which exposes the photoresist once under one mask, masks is exposed twice by splitting them into two, each with half its feature density.

## Challenges for k‚â•3

For k‚â•3, the MAX-k-CUT problem becomes significantly more challenging. It's not approximable within O(|E|) and remains NP-hard even for tri-partite graphs with k=3. Current approaches rely on heuristic algorithms such as using "pairwise coloring" techniques.

---

## Future Directions

- Advanced Approximation

  Developing better approximation algorithms for specific graph classes

- Hardware Acceleration

  Leveraging specialized hardware for graph algorithms

- Machine Learning Integration

  Using ML to guide heuristic choices in complex instances

Future research directions include developing specialized algorithms for industry-specific graph structures, exploring quantum computing approaches for combinatorial optimization, and creating hybrid methods that combine theoretical guarantees with practical performance.
