## 📝 Abstract

The primal-dual method is a powerful technique in the field of approximation algorithms. Originating from linear programming and combinatorial optimization, it has been adapted to tackle NP-hard problems effectively.

This lecture explores the fundamentals, methodology, and applications of this versatile approach, demonstrating its significance in developing efficient solutions for complex computational challenges that would otherwise be intractable.

---

## 🧮 Fundamentals of the PD Method

- Dual Approach 🔄:

   The primal-dual method considers both the primal integer programming formulation and the dual of its LP relaxation. This dual perspective provides valuable insights into the problem structure.

- Iterative Improvement 🔁:

   Starting with a dual feasible solution, the method iteratively improves while constructing a primal integral solution. This process often leads to dual-ascent algorithms.

- Relaxed Conditions ⚖️:

   For NP-hard problems, the method relaxes complementary slackness conditions, allowing for efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees.

---

## 📚 Example: Vertex Cover

- Instance: A graph $G = (V, E)$

- Solution: A vertex cover for $G$, i.e., a subset $U$ such that, for each edge $(u,v) \in E$, at least one of $u$ and $v$ belongs to $U$ 🛡️

- Measure: Cardinality of the vertex cover, i.e. $|U|$ 📏

- Bad News: APX-complete. 😟

- Comment: Admits a PTAS for *planar* graphs [Baker, 1994]. The generalization to $k$-hypergraphs, for $k>1$, is approximable within $k$ [Bar-Yehuda and Even, 1981] and [Hochbaum, 1982a]. 📖

## ⚙️ Greedy-Vertex-Cover

```
┌─┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│1│U = {}                                   │
│2│do chose v in V with max. degree         │
│3│    U = U + {v}                          │
│4│    remove v and every edge adjacent to v│
│5│until all edges covered                  │
│6│return U                                 │
└─┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Requirements:

- Need a (bucket) heap to maintain max. degree ⚖️
- Only for unweighted problems. 🏋️‍♂️

## ⚖️ Weighted Vertex Cover (WVC)

The Weighted Vertex Cover problem extends the basic vertex cover by assigning weights to vertices.

- Instance: $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative vertex weights ${\color{coral} w}: V ↦ N$ 🏷️
- Solution: A vertex cover for $G$, i.e., a subset $U$ such that, for each edge $(u,v) ∈ E$, at least one of $u$ and $v$ belongs to $U$ 🛡️

This problem has applications in network monitoring, resource allocation, and conflict resolution in scheduling. 🌐

def min_vertex_cover(ugraph, weight, coverset = None):
    if coverset is None:
        coverset = set()

    total_dual_cost = 0  # for assertion
    total_prml_cost = 0

## 🧠 General Methodology

1. Formulate as Integer Program 📝:

   Begin by expressing the problem as an integer programming formulation, capturing the essential constraints and objectives.

2. Consider LP Relaxation Dual ⚖️:

   Analyze the dual of the linear programming relaxation, which provides a lower bound on the optimal solution.

3. Iterative Improvement 🔁:

   Incrementally increase dual variables while constructing a primal solution, ensuring feasibility and optimality conditions are maintained.

4. Approximation Analysis 📊:

   Evaluate the approximation ratio based on the relationship between the constructed primal and dual solutions.

   The method provides mathematically rigorous bounds on solution quality, ensuring reliable performance.

- Combinatorial Algorithms 🧩:

   Often leads to efficient combinatorial algorithms, avoiding the need for solving large linear programs.

---

## 🔄 Generic PD for Cover Problems

1. Initialize 🏁:

   Begin with an empty solution set $A$ and set all dual variables $y$ to 0.

2. Iterate 🔁:

   While the solution A is not feasible, identify violated connectivity requirements, increase corresponding dual variables, and add edges to $A$ when dual constraints become tight.

3. Prune ✂️:

   Remove unnecessary edges from $A$ to optimize the final solution.

4. Return Solution 🎯

   Output the optimized solution with provable approximation guarantees based on the relationship between primal and dual values.

## 📚 Example: WVC for Hypergraph

A hypergraph extends the concept of a graph by allowing edges to connect any number of vertices. The vertex cover problem for hypergraphs requires finding a minimum weight set of vertices that intersects with every hyperedge, making it more complex than the standard graph version.

- Instance: $H = (V, E)$ with non-negative vertex weights ${\color{coral} w}: V ↦ N$ 🏷️
- Solution: A vertex cover for $H$, i.e., a subset $U$ such that, for each edge $e ∈ E$, at least one of adj($e$) belongs to $U$ 🛡️
