# ☯ Primal-Dual Method for Approximation Algorithms

## Abstract

The primal-dual method is a "powerful" technique in the field of approximation algorithms. Originating from linear programming and combinatorial optimization, it has been adapted to tackle NP-hard problems effectively. This presentation will explore the fundamentals, methodology, and applications of this versatile approach, demonstrating its significance in developing efficient solutions for complex computational challenges.

---

## Fundamentals of PD Method

- Dual Approach:

   The primal-dual method considers both the primal integer programming formulation and the dual of its LP relaxation. This dual perspective provides valuable insights into the problem structure.

- Iterative Improvement:

   Starting with a dual feasible solution, the method iteratively improves while constructing a primal integral solution. This process often leads to dual-ascent algorithms.

- Relaxed Conditions:

   For NP-hard problems, the method relaxes complementary slackness conditions, allowing for efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees.

---

## Example: Vertex Cover

- Instance: $G = (V, E)$ 

- Solution: A vertex cover for $G$, i.e., a subset $U$ such that, for each edge $(u,v) \in E$, at least one of $u$ and $v$ belongs to $U$

- Measure: Cardinality of the vertex cover, i.e. $|U|$

- Bad News: APX-complete.

- Comment: Admits a PTAS for *planar* graphs [Baker, 1994]. The generalization to $k$-hypergraphs, for $k>1$, is approximable within $k$ [Bar-Yehuda and Even, 1981] and [Hochbaum, 1982a].

## Greedy-Vertex-Cover

```
┌─┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│1│U = {}                                   │
│2│do chose v in V with max. degree         │
│3│    U = U + {v}                          │
│4│    remove v and every edge adjacent to v│
│5│until all edges covered                  │
│6│return U                                 │
└─┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Requirements:

- Need a (bucket) heap to maintain max. degree
- Only for unweighted problems.

## Weighted Vertex Cover (WVC)

- Solution: A vertex cover for $G$, i.e., a subset $U$ such that, for each edge $(u,v) ∈ E$, at least one of $u$ and $v$ belongs to $U$

## Primal-dual WVC

- **Input** Graph $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative vertex weights $w$;
- **Output** Vertex cover $U$ of $G$;
- Let DLP<sub>VC</sub> be the dual of the LP
  relaxation of ILP<sub>VC</sub>;
- ~~**for** each dual variable $y$ of DLP<sub>VC</sub> **do** $y$ := 0;~~
- $U := 0$;
- **while** $U$ is not a vertex cover **do**
    - Let $e = (u, v)$ be an edge not covered by $U$;
    - Increase $y_e$ until a constraint of DLP<sub>VC</sub> becomes tight;
    - **if** $\sum_{e \in E} y_{e}$ is tight **then**
        - $U := U \cup \{u\}$
    - **else**
        - $U := U \cup \{v\}$
- **return** $U$

## Python Implementation

```python
def min_vertex_cover(ugraph, weight, coverset = None):
    if coverset is None:
        coverset = set()

    total_dual_cost = 0  # for assertion
    total_prml_cost = 0
    gap = copy.copy(weight)

    for utx, vtx in ugraph.edges():
        if utx in coverset or vtx in coverset:
            continue
        if gap[utx] < gap[vtx]:
            utx, vtx = vtx, utx  # swap
        coverset.add(vtx)
        total_dual_cost += gap[vtx]
        total_prml_cost += weight[vtx]
        gap[utx] -= gap[vtx]
        gap[vtx] = 0

    assert total_dual_cost <= total_prml_cost
    return coverset, total_prml_cost
```

## General Methodology

1. Formulate as Integer Program:

   Begin by expressing the problem as an integer programming formulation, capturing the essential constraints and objectives.

2. Consider LP Relaxation Dual:

   Analyze the dual of the linear programming relaxation, which provides a lower bound on the optimal solution.

3. Iterative Improvement:

   Incrementally increase dual variables while constructing a primal solution, ensuring feasibility and optimality conditions are maintained.

4. Approximation Analysis:

   Evaluate the approximation ratio based on the relationship between the constructed primal and dual solutions.

---

## Key Strengths of the PD Method

- Provable Approximation Guarantees:

   The method provides mathematically rigorous bounds on solution quality, ensuring reliable performance.

- Combinatorial Algorithms:

   Often leads to efficient combinatorial algorithms, avoiding the need for solving large linear programs.

- Problem Structure Insights:

   Offers deep insights into the underlying structure of complex optimization problems.

- Wide Applicability:

   Suitable for a broad range of NP-hard problems across various domains of computer science and operations research.

---

## Generic PD Algorithm for Cover Problems

1. Initialize:

   Begin with an empty solution set $A$ and set all dual variables $y$ to 0.

2. Iterate:

   While the solution A is not feasible, identify violated connectivity requirements, increase corresponding dual variables, and add edges to $A$ when dual constraints become tight.

3. Prune:

   Remove unnecessary edges from $A$ to optimize the final solution.

## Python Implementation

```python
def pd_cover(
    violate: Callable, weight, soln: Set
) -> Tuple[Set, Union[int, float]]:
    total_prml_cost = 0
    total_dual_cost = 0
    gap = copy.copy(weight)
    for S in violate():
        min_vtx = min(S, key=lambda vtx: gap[vtx])
        min_val = gap[min_vtx]
        soln.add(min_vtx)
        total_prml_cost += weight[min_vtx]
        total_dual_cost += min_val
        for vtx in S:
            gap[vtx] -= min_val
    assert total_dual_cost <= total_prml_cost
    return soln, total_prml_cost
```
