-> ## Why? <-

Also known as L-shaped, orthogonal, axis-aligned, Manhattan 

Used in integrated circuits

General representation is not storage optimized

GDSII

-----------------------------------------------------

-> ## The Power of Canonicalization <-

Convert to canonical form

Always start from x direction, then y direction

Small idea makes a big change?

----------------------------------------------------

-> ## Algorithms <-

Number of vertices is small

Area

Polygon Creation

Orthogonal convex hull

Rectilinear Stenier Tree
