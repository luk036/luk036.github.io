# Introduction

## Redundant Via Insertion

- Also known as double via insertion.
- Original idea is simple: if one via fails, another one still can works.
- Post-routing RVI (many EDA tools now have this feature)
- Considering RVI during routing

## Maximum Bipartite Matching Formulation

- Historically, the pure RVI problem was formulated as maximum bipartite matching problem.
- Can be solved in polynomial time by using a max-flow algorithm.
- Note: the dual problem is a min-cut problem.
- Can be formulated in an ILP form.
- The objective is "correct":
  - each primal via (PV) matches at least one redundant via (RV).
- However, the formulation does not take care of conflicts between RV's.


---

## Maximum Independent Set Formulation

- Later, the problem was formulated as a maximum independent set problem (MIS)
- Can take care of conflicts between RV's.
- Can be formulated in ILP form.
- However, the objective is "wrong":
  - some PV's may get more than one RV, while some others may get none of RV.
- MIS is NP-hard for general graphs.

---

## New formulation

- Combine of two formulations is what we want (Yes!).
  - Matching PV and RV as many as possible with independent set constraints.
- Can be formulated in ILP form.
- NP-hard? If yes, any good heuristic?

---

## Minimum Vertex Cover Formulation

- MIS is equivalent to minimum vertex cover problem (MVCP)
  - Maximizing #RV inserted is equivalent to minimizing #RV removed.

- ILP form of MVCP:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
   \text{minimize}   & \sum_{v \in V} x_v \\
   \text{subject to} & x_u + x_v \geq 1 \; \forall (u,v) \in E \\
    & x_v \in \{0,1\} \; \forall v \in V
  \end{array}$$

- We only keep the constraint part.

## Considering RVI + DP

- Assume the original design already has a valid coloring solution, i.e., odd-cycle free.
- However, reassign the coloring of PV may help to resolve the conflicts between RV's and PV's
- Vertex Cover constraint is replaced with Odd Cycle Cover constraint.
- The objective is unchanged.
- NP-hard? If yes, any good heuristic?
- How about Triple Patterning?

## Considering RVI + DSA + DP

- Directed self assembly is still not mature.
- 2x2 four-hole pattern for 1PV+2RV+1Dummy may not be a good idea. Better than 1PV alone?
- The template assignment problem can be formulated as a set packing problem.
- One possible way is to generate different sets of maximal set packing solution and then solve the RVI + DP problems. Choose the best one as the final solution. Better than ILP if the problem size is small?
