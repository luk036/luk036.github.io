# Redundant Via Insertion + MP

## Abtract

- Redundant Via Insertion (RVI) is a simple yet effective technique for reducing the yield loss caused by via failures during semiconductor manufacturing process.
- Traditionally, its optimal insertion problem have been formulated as maximum bipartite matching (MBM) and maximum Independent Set (MIS), either in concurrent routing or post-routing stage.
- The MBM formulation can be transformated into a maximum-flow problem, and hence can be solved efficiently using a network flow algorithm.
- However, due to the fact that the formulation cannot take care of the conflicts among redundant vias, the main stream of researches quickly went to the MIS camp.
- Nevertheless, under the MIS formulation, some primal vias (PVs) could have more than one redundant via (RV) while some PVs could get none, which is not optimal from the yield improvement's perspective.
- In this paper, we propose to combine the two formulations into a maximum bipartite matching with independent set constraints.
- First, an ILP formulation is presented.
- Then, a heuristic algorithm is then proposed.

# Introduction

## Redundant Via Insertion

- Also known as double via insertion.
- Original idea is simple: if one via fails, another one still can works.

## RVI-aware routing vs. Post-routing RVI

- Post-routing RVI was popular (many EDA tools have this feature)
- Main goal of RVI: improve yield (nice-to-have)
- Main goal of routing: timing (must satisfy)
- RVI consumes very little routing resource.
- Reduce via resistence. No negative impact on the timing.
- RVI-aware routing has better result.

## Lithography effect

- In sub-10nm, the issue become complicated.
- Via could be generated by multiple patterning, complementray e-beam, Directed Self-Assembly, or EUV.


## Lithography-aware RVI vs. RVI-aware lithography

- When RVI was proposed, the lithography issue was not servere.
- In reality, if not address the lithographical conflict, both primal vias and redundant via will fails.
- One possible way is to generate as many as RV candidates as possible during the routing stage, and then select the candidates later during the lithography optimization.

## Maximum Bipartite Matching Formulation

- Historically, the pure RVI problem was formulated as maximum bipartite matching problem.
- Can be solved in polynomial time by using a max-flow algorithm.
- Note: the dual problem is a min-cut problem.
- Can be formulated in an ILP form.
- The objective is "correct":
  - each primal via (PV) matches at least one redundant via (RV).
- However, the formulation does not take care of conflicts between RV's.


---

## Maximum Independent Set Formulation

- Later, the problem was formulated as a maximum independent set problem (MIS)
- Can take care of conflicts between RV's.
- Can be formulated in ILP form.
- However, the objective is "wrong":
  - some PV's may get more than one RV, while some others may get none of RV.
- MIS is NP-hard for general graphs.

---

## New formulation

- Combine of two formulations is what we want (Yes!).
  - Matching PV and RV as many as possible with independent set constraints.
- Can be formulated in ILP form.
- NP-hard? If yes, any good heuristic?

---

## Minimum Vertex Cover Formulation

- MIS is equivalent to minimum vertex cover problem (MVCP)
  - Maximizing #RV inserted is equivalent to minimizing #RV removed.

- ILP form of MVCP:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
   \text{minimize}   & \sum_{v \in V} x_v \\
   \text{subject to} & x_u + x_v \geq 1 \; \forall (u,v) \in E \\
    & x_v \in \{0,1\} \; \forall v \in V
  \end{array}$$

- We only keep the constraint part.

## Considering RVI + DP

- Assume the original design already has a valid coloring solution, i.e., odd-cycle free.
- However, reassign the coloring of PV may help to resolve the conflicts between RV's and PV's
- Vertex Cover constraint is replaced with Odd Cycle Cover constraint.
- The objective is unchanged.
- NP-hard? If yes, any good heuristic?
- How about Triple Patterning?

## Considering RVI + DSA + DP

- Directed self assembly is still not mature.
- 2x2 four-hole pattern for 1PV+2RV+1Dummy may not be a good idea. Better than 1PV alone?
- The template assignment problem can be formulated as a set packing problem.
- One possible way is to generate different sets of maximal set packing solution and then solve the RVI + DP problems. Choose the best one as the final solution. Better than ILP if the problem size is small?
