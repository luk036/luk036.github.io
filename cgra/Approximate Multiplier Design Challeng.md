## 1. Introduction: The Need for Approximate Computing (3 min) üöÄüí°

*   Approximate computing (AxC) has emerged as a **new paradigm** for high-performance and energy-efficient circuit and system design üå±‚ö°.
*   **Motivation**: Conventional technologies face challenges to improve circuit performance and power efficiency due to limits at the nanometer scale and increasing power density. This results in "**dark silicon**" where parts of the chip must be powered off.
*   AxC is driven by challenges from **massive data** and **complex computations** in modern applications like AI üìäü§ñ.
*   Many applications like multimedia, recognition, classification, and **machine learning can tolerate some errors** üôè‚úÖ. Humans often have perceptual limitations and tolerate meaning errors in output quality for image, audio, or video processing.

## 2. Approximate Arithmetic Circuits & Multipliers (4 min) ‚öôÔ∏èüî¢

*   Approximate arithmetic circuits offer trade-offs between **output accuracy and computation efforts**, yielding superior performance (delay and area) compared to traditional circuits at the cost of computational accuracy.
*   Approximate adders and multipliers trade **accuracy for hardware efficiency** ‚öôÔ∏èüìâ.
*   A multiplier typically involves three stages: partial product generation, partial product reduction, and final addition.
*   **Design Methodologies** for Approximate Arithmetic Circuits include:
    *   **Voltage Overscaling (VOS)**: Lowers supply voltage to reduce power, increases critical path delay potentially causing timing errors. Error characteristics are **nondeterministic** and affected by variations.
    *   **Redesigning Logic Circuits**: Modifying or removing elements, simplifying truth tables or Karnaugh maps. Results in circuits with **deterministic error characteristics**.
    *   **Simplification Algorithms**: Converting complex operations (multiplication, division) into simpler ones (addition, subtraction). Can improve performance and energy efficiency, but accuracy tends to be relatively low.
    *   **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining several approximate techniques.
*   **Approximate Multiplier Specific Techniques**:
    *   Approximation in Partial Product (PP) generation or PP tree.
    *   **Approximation including truncation** in the PP tree. Truncation is effective in reducing delay and energy for unsigned designs.
    *   Using approximate adders, counters, or compressors in PP reduction.
    *   Using **Logarithmic Approximation (LMs)**. LMs tend to be hardware-efficient but with rather low accuracy.
    *   Using **Automated Processes** like genetic programming to generate designs.
*   **Evaluation Metrics**: Both error characteristics and circuit measurements must be considered. Key metrics include Error Rate (ER), Error Distance (ED), Relative Error Distance (RED), Mean ED (MED), and **Mean Relative Error Distance (MRED)**. Circuit measurements cover delay, area, and power.
*   Finding the **best trade-off** between quality and other design parameters such as power and delay is crucial. Energy (PDP) vs. Accuracy (MRED) plots are used to show trade-offs.

## 3. Challenges in Design (6 min) üèóÔ∏èü§î

*   **Balancing Multiple Design Goals**: Approximate multipliers introduce accuracy as a key design parameter alongside performance, area, and power, making the identification of the most suitable design quite challenging. Achieving good **energy-accuracy tradeoffs** is a significant challenge.
*   **Selecting Approximation Techniques**: The computation error and energy efficiency largely depend on **how and where the approximation is introduced** into a design. Choosing the most effective techniques (e.g., truncation vs. LMs vs. simplified logic) for a given application is complex. Some methods like Voltage Overscaling introduce **nondeterministic errors**, which are harder to manage.
*   **Architecture and Integration**: Deciding on the multiplier architecture (e.g., array, Wallace tree, Booth) and determining the optimal placement of approximate and exact sub-modules within the main multiplier is critical.
*   **Designing Effective Error Compensation**: For designs like fixed-width Booth multipliers, sophisticated error compensation schemes are needed to improve accuracy, make errors symmetrical, and reduce bias/MSE. Designing these effectively is a challenge.
*   **Scalability and Customization**: The circuit and error characteristics of approximate arithmetic circuits, including multipliers, can vary significantly for different sizes or bit-widths, especially as some designs are tailored for specific widths. Creating designs that are efficiently scalable or easily customizable for various requirements is challenging.
*   **Lack of Advanced Design Automation Tools**: Developing comprehensive design automation tools for complex approximate systems is an area for future work.

## 4. Challenges in Evaluation & Characterization (6 min) üî¨üìä

*   **Accurate Error Quantification**: Precisely quantifying and bounding the accuracy loss introduced by approximation is of paramount importance. Measuring the "degree of approximation" accurately is crucial for real-life applications.
*   **Efficient Error Metric Computation**: Computing error metrics is essential, but existing simulation techniques may not be effective for large complex designs due to immense runtime increase and accuracy decrease. Analytical approaches also become hard and complicated with increased design complexity if accuracy is considered. BDD-based approaches suffer from state explosion problems for larger circuits. Developing fast and accurate error metrics evaluation methodologies is a key challenge. SAT solvers are being explored to enable exact error metrics calculation in a more scalable way. However, the runtime of SAT-based methods can still increase significantly with the number of inputs and linearly with the number of errors that need to be discovered.
*   **Characterizing Error Behavior**: It is important to study the errors for different input distributions using appropriate error/QoS metrics. Understanding and characterizing error biases is crucial, as large error biases can significantly degrade accuracy in applications.
*   **Joint Hardware-Accuracy Evaluation**: Conventionally, performance and power efficiency were pursued independently. A challenge is to jointly consider hardware efficiency (delay, area, power) and accuracy to guide design choices. This involves synthesizing circuits under different design constraints (delay-optimized, area-optimized) and evaluating both aspects.

## 5. Challenges in Application (6 min) üì±ü§ñ

*   **Application Analysis and Mapping**: It is essential to analyze the application in detail to identify acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) and specify error metrics. Not all computations can be approximated; identifying non-critical tasks and isolating them from critical ones is important. Accurately mapping approximate hardware (like multipliers) to specific program parts is part of this.
*   **Managing Application Quality**: Inaccurate adders and multipliers can limit the overall application quality regardless of the paired circuit elements. Quantifying the quality loss of the whole system is a challenge. It is important to prove the resilience of the application and ensure QoS constraints are met.
*   **Error Accumulation in Complex Operations**: In applications involving complex computations like multiple matrix multiplications, errors can accumulate. While a larger approximation might be tolerable in the multiplication itself, errors in **addition** can be more vulnerable in such cases.
*   **Impact on Robustness and Critical Tasks**: The impact of approximate computing techniques on the robustness of Machine Learning models is merely explored. Understanding what types of approximations can still be utilized, especially for **critical applications**, and what are the limits of approximate computing in such domains are open challenges. **Verification** (quantifying and bounding accuracy loss) is a major open research challenge, particularly in the context of mission-critical tasks and applications. Approximation adds another degree of inaccuracy on top of ML models, which are inherently inexact.
*   **Software-Hardware Integration**: Integrating approximate arithmetic circuits requires support from the software stack, including approximation libraries/frameworks, compiler extensions, runtime systems, and language annotations. Enabling programmers to specify QoS constraints and mark code regions for approximation is part of this challenge. Java extensions and compiler frameworks have been proposed.
