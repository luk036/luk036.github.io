### Introduction - What is FPGA-EDA? 🤔

- **FPGA**: Field-Programmable Gate Array. 🧩
    - Think of them as electronic "lego". 🧱
    - Unlike fixed-function chips (ASICs), FPGAs can be reconfigured for different tasks. ♻️
- **EDA**: Electronic Design Automation. 💻
    - A category of software tools used to design and verify electronic systems, like FPGAs. 🛠️
    - Essential because tasks like "pre-design" and "assemble" for FPGAs are too complex without computer help. 🤯
- **FPGA-EDA** enables not only designing to and programming an FPGA but also architecting new FPGAs and automating implementation. 🏗️
- This presentation covers the holistic approach to FPGA-EDA, from architecture to programming. 🌐

- **Key Steps**:
    - **Logic Optimization**: Simplifying the logic while preserving functionality. Includes:
        - **Combinational Optimization**: Deals with logic gates. 🚪
        - **Sequential Optimization**: Deals with registers and memory, aiming to reduce elements or latency. ⏳
    - **Technology Mapping**: Fitting the optimized logic onto the specific FPGA's programmable logic blocks (like LUTs). 🗺️

### Physical Implementation - Placing and Wiring Components 🗺️

- **Role**: Decides how the logic netlist is physically mapped onto the target FPGA device. 🎯
- **Main Stages**:
    1.  **Packing**: Grouping logical elements into physical FPGA blocks (e.g., clustering logic into CLBs). Input is a synthesized netlist, output is a clustered netlist. 📦
    2.  **Placement**: Assigning packed blocks to specific locations on the FPGA fabric. Input is a clustered netlist, output is a placed netlist. 📍
    3.  **Routing**: Connecting the placed blocks by finding paths through the FPGA's interconnect resources. Input is a placed netlist, output is a routed netlist. 🛣️

### Physical Implementation - Placement Details 📍

- **Goal**: Assign physical locations to the packed logic blocks. 🎯
- **Common Algorithms**:
    - **Simulated Annealing**: A meta-heuristic approach that explores the solution space by accepting moves that might worsen the solution temporarily to escape local optima. Key aspects include placement schedule (annealing strategy). 🔥
    - **Analytic Placement**: Often used for larger designs.
- **Optimization Objectives**: Minimizing wirelength, reducing congestion, meeting timing constraints. ⏱️
