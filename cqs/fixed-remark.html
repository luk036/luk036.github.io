### What are Combinatorial Objects? 🤔🔢

*   Discrete structures like permutations, combinations, graphs, strings.
*   Generating lists of these objects is **immensely important** in mathematics and computer science.
*   Widely used in:
    *   Computational biology 🧬
    *   Combinatorial chemistry 🧪
    *   Operations research 📈
    *   Data mining ⛏️
    *   Calibration of colour printers (specifically bracelets) 🖨️

---

### Necklaces, Lyndon Words, and Bracelets 📿

*   These are specific types of k-ary strings (strings using an alphabet of size k).
*   **Necklace:** A **lexicographically minimal** k-ary string equivalent under **rotation**.
    *   *Example:* `0011` is a necklace from the rotation set `{0011, 0110, 1100, 1001}`.
*   **Lyndon Word:** An **aperiodic necklace** (a necklace that is its own shortest Lyndon prefix).
    *   *Example:* `0001` is a Lyndon word from the rotation set `{0001, 0010, 0100, 1000}`.
*   **Bracelet:** A **lexicographically minimal** k-ary string **symmetric under rotation and reversal**.
    *   *Example (binary):* `001100` is a bracelet because its rotations (`011000`, etc.) and reversals (`001100` reversed is `001100`) are considered, and `001100` is the smallest among them.

---

### What is "Fixed Density"? 🎯📊

*   A k-ary string is of **fixed density** if the **number of occurrences of symbol 0 is fixed**.
*   The sources define density `d` as the **number of non-zero symbols**.
    *   So, a string of length `n` with `d` non-zero symbols has `n-d` zeros.
*   We use notation like:
    *   $N(n, d, k)$: set of k-ary necklaces length `n`, density `d`.
    *   $P(n, d, k)$: set of k-ary prenecklaces length `n`, density `d`.
    *   $B(n, d, k)$: set of k-ary bracelets length `n`, density `d`.
*   Cardinality denoted $|N(n, d, k)|$, $|P(n, d, k)|$, $|B(n, d, k)|$.

---

### Counting Fixed Density Objects 📊🧮

*   The number of necklaces with specific counts of each symbol $(n_0, n_1, ..., n_{k-1})$ is given by a formula involving Euler's totient function $\phi$:

    $$N_k(n_0, n_1, ..., n_{k-1}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j \mid \gcd(n_0,...,n_{k-1})} \phi(j) \frac{(n/j)!}{(n_0/j)! \cdots (n_{k-1}/j)!}$$

*   The cardinality of necklaces $|N(n, d, k)|$ is:

    $$|N(n, d, k)| = \sum_{n_1 + \cdots + n_{k-1} = d} N_k(n-d, n_1, \cdots, n_{k-1})$$

*   For bracelets, the cardinality is related to necklaces: $|N(n, k)| \leq 2|B(n, k)|$ and $|N(n, d, k)| \leq 2|B(n, d, k)|$.

---

### Generating Combinatorial Objects - Background ⏳🔄

*   Algorithms exist for generating necklaces, Lyndon words, and variants.
*   Recursive frameworks like Cattell et al. are used.
*   Algorithms for **necklaces with fixed density** exist.
*   Algorithms for **necklaces with fixed content** (fixed counts of *each* symbol) exist.
*   Algorithms for generating **bracelets** exist.
    *   Lisonek modified necklace generation.
    *   Sawada developed a **Constant Amortized Time (CAT)** algorithm.

---

### What is a CAT Algorithm? ⚡⏱️

*   **CAT (Constant Amortized Time):** An algorithm where the **total number of basic operations performed is proportional to the number of objects generated**.
*   On average, **each successive object is generated in constant time**.
*   This is **extremely desirable** in generation algorithms.
*   The goal of the paper is to present a CAT algorithm for fixed density bracelets.

---

### Generating Fixed-Density Necklaces ⚙️📿

*   A **k-ary necklace** with **fixed density** has a fixed number of non-zero characters.
*   Example: $N(4, 2, 3)$ (length 4, 2 non-zero chars) = {0011, 0012, 0021, 0022, 0101, 0102, 0202}.

*   Motivation: Applications in areas like hardware/software testing, combinatorial chemistry, and generating **difference covers**. 🧪💻
    *   An $(n, d)$ difference cover can be mapped from binary necklaces $N(n, d, 2)$.

*   Counting fixed-density necklaces is known.
*   Efficiently *generating* them was an open problem before this work. Previous algorithms were not CAT. 🚧

---

### Fixed-Density Necklace Algorithm (GenFix) 🎯

*   Approach: Modify existing recursive necklace algorithms.
    *   Original $\text{Gen}(t, p)$ generates all prenecklaces (prefixes of necklaces).
    *   A string $\alpha$ is a prenecklace iff $a_{j-p} = a_j$ for $j=p+1...n$, where $p=\text{lyn}(\alpha)$ (length of longest Lyndon prefix).

*   **Modified Algorithm (Gen2):** Focus on prenecklaces whose last character is non-zero.
    *   Uses arrays $a$ (position of non-zero char) and $b$ (value of non-zero char).
    *   Recursively determines valid positions and values for the *next non-zero character*.
    *   Pseudocode $\text{Gen2}(t, p)$ Figure 3.5.

---

*   **Fixed-Density Optimization (GenFix):** Add restrictions to Gen2 for fixed density $d$.
    1.  Restrict position of first non-zero character.
    2.  Restrict position of the $i$-th non-zero character.
    3.  Stop recursion after placing $d-1$ non-zero characters.
    4.  Determine valid values for the $d$-th (last) non-zero character in the $\text{PrintIt}(p)$ function.

*   Pseudocode $\text{GenFix}(t, p)$ Figure 3.7.

---

### Fixed-Density Necklace Analysis ⏱️📊

*   **Goal:** Prove $\text{GenFix}$ is CAT.
*   Analysis focuses on the size of the computation tree. 🌳
*   Total work is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.
*   Each node requires constant work (excluding $\text{PrintIt}$ which is handled).
*   Need to bound the size of the computation tree relative to the number of necklaces produced.
*   Computation tree size bounded by sum of prenecklaces with specific length and density.
    *   $\text{CompTree}_k(n, d) \leq \sum \sum P'(j, i, k)$.
    *   $P'(n, d, k)$ (prenecklaces of length n, density d, last char non-zero) $\leq N(n, d, k) + L(n, d, k)$ (Necklaces + Lyndon words).
    *   Bounds on $L(n, d, k)$ and $N(n, d, k)$ are used.
        *   $N(n, d, k) \leq 2 L(n, d, k)$.
        *   $L(n, d, k) \leq \frac{1}{n} \binom{n}{d} (k-1)^d$.

---

*   Using these bounds, the computation tree size is shown to be proportional to the number of necklaces generated.
    *   Ratio $\text{CompTree} / N(n, d, k)$ is bounded by a constant.
*   **Theorem 4.7:** $\text{GenFix}$ is CAT. ✅

---

### The Problem: Generating Fixed Density Bracelets 🤔🔧

*   "No significant work is done to list restricted classes of bracelets" like fixed density.
*   Goal: Develop an **algorithm for lexicographic listing of bracelets with fixed density**.
*   The algorithm should work for **arbitrarily large alphabet size** (k).
*   The algorithm should generate each successive bracelet in **constant amortized time**.

---

### Basic Building Block: Generating Prenecklaces (Naive) 🏗️🔨

*   Recursive algorithms for generating prenecklaces are based on the **Fundamental Theorem of Necklaces**.
*   **Theorem 2.1:** Let $\alpha = a_1...a_{n-1} \in P(n-1, k)$ and $p = \text{lyn}(\alpha)$ (length of longest Lyndon prefix).
    *   The string $\alpha b$ is in $P(n, k)$ **iff** $a_{n-p} \leq b \leq k-1$.
    *   $\text{lyn}(\alpha b)$ is:
        1. $p$ if $a_{n-p} = b$, or
        2. $n$ if $a_{n-p} < b$.
*   This theorem tells us which character $b$ can be appended to a prenecklace $\alpha$ to get a new prenecklace $\alpha b$.
*   A simple recursive algorithm $\text{Necklace}(t, p)$ can list prenecklaces (and necklaces/Lyndon words with a $\text{Print}$ function check).

---

### Naive Fixed Density Bracelet Algorithm (SimpleBFD) 🚶‍♂️🐢

*   A simple modification of the necklace algorithm ($\text{SimpleBFD}(t, p, r)$) can list fixed density bracelets.
*   It needs to ensure:
    1.  All generated prenecklaces have density $d$. (Requires checking non-zero count).
    2.  Only list bracelets.
*   Checking if a string is a bracelet usually involves comparing it to the necklace of its reversed string. This is O(n) and **prevents a CAT algorithm**.
*   Instead, a lemma from Sawada is used:
    *   **Lemma 3.1:** A necklace $\alpha = a_1...a_n$ is a bracelet **iff**
        1. $a_{r+1}...a_n \leq a_n...a_{r+1}$ and
        2. $a_1...a_t > a_t...a_1$ for no $t$,
        where $r$ is the length of the longest prefix equal to its reversal ($a_1...a_r = a_r...a_1$).
*   This involves comparing the current prenecklace with its reversal using $\text{CheckRev}(t)$.

---

### $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ Function 🤔🔁🔍

*   The $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ function compares the prefix $a_1...a_t$ with its reversal $a_t...a_1$.
*   It returns:
    *   $1$ if $a_1...a_t < a_t...a_1$
    *   $0$ if $a_1...a_t = a_t...a_1$
    *   $-1$ if $a_1...a_t > a_t...a_1$
*   If $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ returns $-1$, further generation from this prenecklace is stopped because it cannot be the minimal representative of a bracelet.
*   If $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ returns $0$, the parameter $r$ (length of longest equal-to-reversal prefix) is updated.
*   When length $n$ is reached, $a_{r+1}...a_n$ is compared to its reversal.
*   *Issue:* This naive comparison is still **not constant time**.

---

### Towards an Efficient Algorithm (CAT) 💪⚡

*   The naive algorithm is inefficient.
*   An efficient (CAT) algorithm is presented by merging **optimizations from two existing CAT algorithms**:
    1.  Generating necklaces with fixed density.
    2.  Generating bracelets.

---

### Fixed Density Optimizations (from) ⬆️📈

*   **Optimization 1: Increase Density, Not Length:** Instead of appending one character, append characters to **increase the density by one**.
    *   Arrays $a$ (positions of non-zero symbols) and $b$ (values of non-zero symbols) are used.
    *   $t$ = current density, $a_t$ = length of current prenecklace.
    *   Determine valid position and value for the **next non-zero symbol**.
    *   Maximum position: $a_{t+1} = a_{t+1-p} + a_p$.
    *   Minimum value: $b_{a_{t+1}} = b_{a_{t+1-p}}$. (Larger values also valid).
*   **Optimization 2: Density Constraints:**
    *   First non-zero symbol between $n-d+1$ and $(n-1)/d+1$.
    *   $i$-th non-zero symbol at or before $n-d+i$-th position.
    *   Last non-zero symbol must be at $n$-th position.
    *   Stop recursive generation when density $d-1$ is reached. The last symbol (at position $n$) is handled separately.
    *   Constant time test added to determine valid values for the last non-zero symbol at position $n$.

---

### Bracelet Optimizations (from) 🔄✨

*   **Optimization 1: Limited Reverse Checks:** If a necklace $\alpha$ is of the form
     $$a...a_{i_{i+1}}...a_n, \qquad a \neq a_{i+1},$$
     only check reverse rotations starting with the same repeated symbol $a_i$.
    *   Doesn't require generating the entire necklace.
    *   Still requires O(t) work per check.
*   **Optimization 2: Incremental Reversal Check:** The final test comparing $a_{r+1}...a_n$ to its reversal can be done incrementally.
    *   Start comparison once the "middle point" $\lfloor (n-r)/2 \rfloor + r$ is reached.
    *   Use an additional parameter $RS$ (Reverse Status) to store intermediate results.
    *   Update $RS$ based on comparing the current character $a_{t-1}$ with its corresponding character in the reversed string
        $a[n-t+2+r]$.
    *   This makes the comparison a **constant time test per recursive call**.

---

### Merging Optimizations 🤝🔀

*   Combine the fixed density (increasing density, position/value arrays $a$, $b$) and bracelet (limited/incremental reversal checks) optimizations.
*   Recursive scheme $\text{BraceFD}(t, p, r, RS)$.
*   Use $a$ for non-zero positions, $b$ for values.
*   Assume $0 < d < n$, so strings start with $0$.
*   Fixed density optimization means prenecklaces **do not end with 0**.
*   Apply limited reverse checking (Optimization 1) when the form $0^i...0^ib_{a_t}$ is met. Update $r$ if equal, terminate if reversal is less.
*   *Challenge:* Direct merging of the incremental RS update (Optimization 2) and fixed density (increasing density by more than one) is tricky.
    *   The fixed density algorithm can append a block of zeros ($a_t - a_{t-1} > 1$), making the incremental RS check non-constant.

---

### Merging Optimizations - Handling the RS Update 🤔💻🔄

*   The incremental RS update needs to handle cases where multiple characters are appended at once (due to adding non-zero symbol at a specific position).
*   The RS value is computed when $a_t > (n-r)/2 + r$.
*   If $a_t - a_{t-1} > 1$, comparing all characters between $a_{t-1}+1$ and $a_t$ takes non-constant time.
*   Only one non-zero symbol is in the block $0^{a_t-a_{t-1}-1}b_{a_t}$.
*   RS can be computed in unit time if $b_{a_t} \neq b_e$, where $e = n - a_t + r + 1$.
*   If $b_{a_t} = b_e$, need to check the substring of zeros starting at $n - a_t + r + 2$. Use variables $s_i$ (density up to pos $i$) and $l_i$ (length of zero substring starting at pos $i$).
*   $l_{e+1} = a_{s_{e+1}} - a_{s_e} - 1$.
*   RS update rule based on $b_{a_t}$, $b_e$, $a[t]-a[t-1]-1$, and $l[e+1]$.

---

### The Algorithm Structure (High-Level) 🏗️✨

*   Algorithm is a recursive scheme $\text{BraceFD}(t, p, r, RS)$.
*   Initialisation $\text{InitFixed}()$ sets up the calls by placing the first non-zero symbol in valid positions.
*   Generates strings belonging to $N(n, d, k)$ in lexicographic order.
*   Eliminates necklaces whose reversed rotations are less than the necklace itself.
*   **Theorem 3.1:** $\text{InitFixed}()$ lists all elements of $B(n, d, k)$ exactly once in lexicographic order.

---

### Analysis: Proving CAT ⏱️📊

*   Claim: The algorithm works in Constant Amortized Time (CAT).
*   Computation tree represents recursive calls.
*   Size of the computation tree is proportional to $|B(n, d, k)|$. (Compared to fixed density necklace algorithm tree size proportional to $|N(n, d, k)|$ and $|N(n, d, k)| \leq 2|B(n, d, k)|$).
*   The work done *per node* (recursive call) is mostly constant.
*   The non-constant part is the $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ function.
*   To prove CAT, show that **total symbol comparisons by CheckRev(t) is proportional to |B(n, d, k)|**.
*   The total number of prenecklaces generated by the scheme is proportional to $|B(n, d, k)|$.
*   Each comparison in $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ is mapped to a unique prenecklace.

---

### Analysis: The Mapping Proof (Binary Case) 📊🔢

*   Focus first on the binary case (k=2).
*   $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ compares $b_j$ with
    *   $b_{a_t-j}$ for $i+1 \leq j \leq a_t/2$.
    *   Stop when $j > a_t/2$ or
    *   $b_j \neq b_{a_t-j}$.
*   At most one *unequal* comparison per prenecklace. Cost is constant.
*   Need to bound the number of *equal* comparisons.
*   Define a mapping $f(\beta, j)$ for binary prenecklaces $\beta$ and indices $j$ where $\beta[1...j]$ equals its reversal.
    *   $f$ preserves length and content.
*   **Lemma 4.1:** $f(\beta, j)$ is a valid prenecklace generated by the algorithm.
*   **Lemma 4.2:** The mapping $f$ is **one-to-one** for valid $\beta$ and $j$.
*   This one-to-one mapping implies the number of equal comparisons is bounded by the number of prenecklaces generated for the binary case.

---

### Analysis: The Mapping Proof (General Case k > 2) 🌐🔢

*   The binary mapping $f$ doesn't work for $k > 2$.
*   A more complex mapping $g(\beta, j)$ is defined for general $k$.
    *   $g$ preserves length and content.
*   **Lemma 4.3:** $g(\beta, j)$ is a valid prenecklace.
*   **Lemma 4.4:** The mapping $g$ is **one-to-one** for valid $\beta$ and $j$.
*   This one-to-one mapping proves that the total equal comparisons across all prenecklaces is proportional to the number of prenecklaces generated.

---

### Analysis: Final Bound 📈✅

*   Let $P'(n, d, k)$ be the number of prenecklaces generated by the fixed density necklace algorithm.
*   Let $C_k(i)$ be the number of equal comparisons made by $\text{CheckRev}(t)$ on prenecklaces of length $i$.
*   Total equal comparisons: $\sum C_k(i)$ for $i=1$ to $n$.
*   Using Lemma 4.4, $\sum C_k(i)$ for $i=1$ to $n-1$ is bounded by $P'(n, d, k)$.
*   From, $P'(n, d, k)$ is less than $2N(n, d, k)$ for prenecklaces not ending in 0.
*   Also $C_k(n) \leq 2N(n, d, k)$.
*   Total comparisons $\leq (c' + 2)N(n, d, k)$ where c' is a constant.
*   Since $N(n, d, k) \leq 2B(n, d, k)$, Total comparisons $\leq 2(c' + 2)B(n, d, k)$.
*   This is $c \cdot |B(n, d, k)|$ for some constant $c$.
*   **Theorem 4.1:** Total equal comparisons are proportional to $|B(n, d, k)|$.
*   Since all other work is constant per generated prenecklace (and total prenecklaces is proportional to $|B_k(n,d)|$), the algorithm is **CAT**.


---
