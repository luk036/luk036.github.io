## üìù Abstract

This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of alternating minimization and its applications in Electronic Design Automation, covering key concepts, methodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions in this field.

---
## What is Alternating Minimization?

- An iterative optimization technique
- Alternates between optimizing different subsets of variables
- Simplifies complex multi-variable problems

---

## Key Concepts of Alternating Minimization

1. **Variable Partitioning**: Divide variables into two or more blocks.
2. **Iterative Process**: Optimize one block while keeping others fixed.
3. **Convergence**: Typically converges to a local minimum.

---

## Algorithm Overview

1. Initialize variables $x$ and $y$
2. Repeat until convergence:
   - Fix $y$, optimize $x$
   - Fix $x$, optimize $y$
3. Converged solution
