## üìù Abstract

This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of convex fitting using B-splines, covering the fundamental concepts, methodology, applications, challenges, and future directions in this field.

---

## Introduction

- Convex fitting: Approximating data with a convex function
- B-splines: Flexible and powerful basis functions
- Combining convexity constraints with B-spline representation

---

## B-splines Basics

- Piecewise polynomial functions
- Defined by:
  - Degree of polynomials
  - Knot sequence
  - Control points
- Properties:
  - Local support
  - Smoothness
  - Easy to manipulate

---

## B-spline Representation

A B-spline curve is represented as:

$$ f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i B_i(x) $$

Where:
- $c_i$ are control points
- $B_i(x)$ are B-spline basis functions

---

## Ensuring Convexity in B-splines

A sufficient condition for convexity:

$$ c[i+1] - c[i] \geq c[i] - c[i-1] \quad \forall i$$

This ensures that the second derivative is non-negative everywhere.

## Convex Fitting Problem

Given data points $(x_j, y_j)$, we want to:

Minimize: $\sum_j (f(x_j) - y_j)^2$

Subject to: 
- $f$ is convex
- $f$ is a B-spline

---

## Optimization Formulation

Minimize: $\sum_j (\sum_i c_i B_i(x_j) - y_j)^2$

Subject to:
- $c[i+1] - c[i] \geq c[i] - c[i-1]$ for all $i$
- Additional constraints (e.g., boundary conditions)

---

## Solving the Optimization Problem

- Quadratic Programming (QP) problem
- Efficient solvers available (e.g., CVXOPT, MOSEK)
- Can handle large datasets and many control points

## Advantages of B-spline Convex Fitting

1. Flexibility in representing complex convex shapes
2. Smoothness control
3. Local control of the fit
4. Efficient computation and evaluation

## Applications

1. Economics: Production functions, utility functions
2. Statistics: Density estimation
3. Machine Learning: Regularization, model fitting
4. Computer Graphics: Shape modeling
5. Operations Research: Convex cost functions

## üìö Example: Production Function Estimation

- Data: Input-output pairs from a production process
- Goal: Estimate a convex production function
- Approach: Fit a convex B-spline to the data
- Result: Smooth, convex estimate of the production function

## Challenges and Considerations

1. Choosing the number and placement of knots
2. Balancing fit quality and convexity constraints
3. Handling noisy data
4. Extrapolation behavior

---

## Extensions and Variations

1. Multivariate convex fitting
2. Monotone convex fitting
3. Adaptive knot placement
4. Incorporating shape constraints (e.g., asymptotes)

---

## Implementation Tools

- Python: SciPy (B-splines), CVXPY (optimization)
- MATLAB: Curve Fitting Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox
- R: splines package, CVXR for optimization
- Specialized software: SCOP (Shape Constrained Optimization)
