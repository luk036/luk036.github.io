## üìù Abstract

This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of convex programming and its applications in Electronic Design Automation, covering key concepts, methodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions in this field.

## What is Convex Optimization?

- Convex optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that deals with problems where the objective function and the feasible region are both convex. 
- A problem is convex if the objective function $f(x)$ is convex (i.e., $f(\theta x_1 + (1-\theta) x_2) \leq \theta f(x_1) + (1-\theta) f(x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2$ in the domain and $\theta$ in [0, 1]) and the feasible set defined by the constraints is a convex set.

## Key Concepts

1. Convex Functions
2. Convex Sets
3. Convex Optimization Problem
4. Duality
5. KKT Conditions

## Key Characteristics of Convex Optimization

1. **Global Optimum**: Any local minimum is also a global minimum.
2. **Efficient Algorithms**: There are well-established algorithms like Gradient Descent, Interior-Point Methods, and Subgradient Methods to solve these problems efficiently.
3. **Wide Applicability**: Convex optimization is widely used in various fields such as machine learning, finance, engineering, and operations research.

## Basic Formulation

A standard convex optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{minimize} & \quad f(x) \\\\
    \text{subject to} & \quad g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m \\\\
        & \quad h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, \ldots, p
\end{array}
$$

where $f(x)$ is a convex objective function, $g_i(x)$ are convex inequality constraint functions, and $h_j(x)$ are affine equality constraint functions.

## Introduction to CVXPY

CVXPY is an open-source Python library designed for convex optimization. It provides a user-friendly interface for defining and solving convex optimization problems, making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners.

## Key Features of CVXPY

1. **Expressive Syntax**: Allows users to define optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax.
2. **Automatic Differentiation**: Supports automatic differentiation, making it easier to define complex objective functions and constraints.
3. **Solver Integration**: Interfaces with various solvers like ECOS, SCS, and OSQP, allowing users to choose the most appropriate solver for their problem.
4. **Extensibility**: Supports extensions for advanced optimization problems, including mixed-integer programming and stochastic optimization.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use CVXPY:

```python
import cvxpy as cp

# Define the variables
x = cp.Variable()
y = cp.Variable()

# Define the objective function
objective = cp.Minimize((x - 1)**2 + (y - 2.5)**2)

# Define the constraints
constraints = [x + y == 1, x - y >= 1]

# Formulate the problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve the problem
result = problem.solve()

# Output the results
print(f"Optimal value: {result}")
print(f"Optimal x: {x.value}")
print(f"Optimal y: {y.value}")
```
