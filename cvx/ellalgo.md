### ✨ Introduction to the `ellalgo` Package

- Solving Optimization Problems Efficiently ⚡
- Focus on Cutting Plane Methods & Ellipsoid Method ✂️
- A Toolkit for Feasibility & Optimization 🧰

---

### 🤔 What Problem Does `ellalgo` Solve?

- Finding **optimal** or **feasible** solutions within a given search space 🔍
- Handles various types of problems:
  - Feasibility problems ✅
  - Optimization problems (continuous and discrete) 📈
- Designed to be **flexible** and **work with different problem types** 🧩
- Provides a foundation for **solving different varieties of optimization problems** 🏗️

---

### 🎈 The Ellipsoid Method Foundation

- The `ellalgo` package is built upon the concepts of the **Ellipsoid Method** 🏗️
- A key component is representing the search space as an **ellipsoid**
- The algorithm iteratively refines this search space 🔄
- Starts with an initial point and asks an oracle for feedback 🗣️
- Based on the feedback (a "cut"), the ellipsoid (search space) is updated ✂️
- The goal is to shrink the search space to converge towards a solution 🎯

---

### 🥚 The `Ell` Class: Your Search Space

- The `ellalgo` module defines a class `Ell` 🏗️
- It represents an **ellipsoidal search space** 🔍
- Purpose: Providing methods for **updating and manipulating** an ellipsoid 🛠️
- Initialized with:
  - `val`: Initial shape (a number or a list of numbers) 🔢
  - `xc`: Initial position 📍
- The class doesn't provide calculation results directly, but modifies the ellipsoid based on results 🔄

---

### 🧮 Ellipsoid Calculations: `EllCalc`

- The `ellalgo.ell_calc` module provides classes like `EllCalc` and `EllCalcCore` ➗
- These are designed to perform **calculations related to ellipsoids** 🧮
- Specifically used to calculate **how to adjust or "cut"** an ellipsoid based on inputs ✂️
- Handle the **dimension `n`** of the problem space 📏
- Involve mathematical calculations using inputs like 'beta', 'tau', and 'tsq' αβγ

---

### 🔪 Updating the Ellipsoid with Cuts

- The algorithm updates the ellipsoid based on "cuts" provided by the oracle ✂️
- The `Ell` class provides methods to apply these cuts:
  - `update_bias_cut`: Implements a **deep cut** ⚔️
  - `update_central_cut`: Implements a **central cut** ✂️
  - `update_q`: Another method to update the ellipsoid 🔄
- These update methods are part of the `SearchSpace` interface that `Ell` implements 📜

---

### 🧙 Oracles: The Problem's Feedback

- Oracles are a **crucial component** in the cutting plane method 🗝️
- They act as the **problem-specific interface** 🤖
- The algorithm presents a point (`x`) to the oracle 🎯
- The oracle provides **feedback** on that point:
  - Is the point feasible? ✔️
  - Is the point optimal (for optimization problems)? 🏆
  - Provides a "**cut**" - information used to update the search space (the ellipsoid) ✂️
- This feedback guides the algorithm in refining the search 🔍

---

### 🕵️‍♀️ Different Oracles for Different Needs

- The package defines abstract Oracle types:
  - `OracleBS`: For **binary search** assessment. Assesses if a `gamma` value is "good" 🔍
  - `OracleFeas`: A **feasibility oracle**. Determines if a given input is feasible and provides a cut ✅
  - `OracleOptim`: An **optimization oracle**. Assesses feasibility and objective function value for continuous problems, provides a cut 📈
  - `OracleOptimQ`: An **optimization oracle for discrete problems**. Assesses feasibility/objective for discrete problems, provides a cut 🔢
  - `SearchSpace`/`SearchSpaceQ`: Abstract interfaces defining the contract for search space objects (like `Ell`) 📜

---

### ⚙️ Putting It Together: The Algorithms

- The `ellalgo.cutting_plane` module implements various cutting plane algorithms ⚙️
- Examples:
  - `cutting_plane_feas`: For solving **feasibility** problems ✅
  - `cutting_plane_optim`: For solving **continuous optimization** problems 📈
  - `cutting_plane_optim_q`: For solving **discrete optimization** problems 🔢
  - `bsearch`: Implements a **binary search** over a search space 🔍
- These algorithms use an `Ell` object (or similar `SearchSpace`) and the relevant Oracle to find a solution 🎯
- The package also includes `conjugate_gradient` for solving linear systems Ax=b ➗

---

### 📦 Package Structure & Submodules

- The `ellalgo` package is organized into subpackages and submodules 🗂️
- Specific problem types have dedicated oracle implementations listed as submodules:
  - `ellalgo.oracles.ldlt_mgr_module`: Related to LDLT factorization 🧮
  - `ellalgo.oracles.lmi0_oracle`: For Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems
  - `ellalgo.oracles.lowpass_oracle`: For lowpass filter design 🎛️
  - `ellalgo.oracles.profit_oracle`: For profit maximization problems 💰
  - `ellalgo.oracles.profitrb_oracle`: Another profit-related oracle 💸
- These show how the abstract Oracle concept is applied to specific mathematical or engineering problems 🛠️

---

### 🎉 Conclusion & Next Steps

- `ellalgo` provides a **flexible and efficient** way to implement and manipulate ellipsoidal search spaces 🎯
- It's a crucial component in implementing **cutting plane techniques** for optimization ✂️
- Encapsulates complex mathematics for easier use 🧮
- More details can be found in the referenced documentation 📚
