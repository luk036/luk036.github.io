### Overview ✨🔍  

*   **Authors:** Aditi Ghai, Cao Lu, Xiangmin Jiao  
    *   Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University 🏛️  
*   **Context:** Solving large and sparse linear systems $Ax = b$ arising from:
    *   Partial Differential Equation (PDE) discretizations 📐
    *   Fluid dynamics 🌊
    *   Optimization problems ⚙️
    *   Economics, statistics, graph problems 📈
*   **Key Challenge:** These linear systems are often **nonsymmetric** due to the nature of the PDEs, boundary or jump conditions, or discretization methods. 🔄
*   **The Problem:** While many preconditioned KSP methods are available, it is often unclear to users which methods are the *best* for different classes of problems. Users frequently resort to trial-and-error. 🤔
*   **Our Goal:** To present a systematic comparison and establish practical guidelines for choosing effective preconditioned KSP methods. 🎯

---

### The Core Problem: Large-Scale Linear Systems 📈🔥

*   We aim to solve a system of linear equations:
    *   $Ax = b$
    *   Where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a large, sparse, and nonsymmetric matrix, $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the unknown solution vector, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the known right-hand side vector.
*   **Characteristics of these systems:**
    *   **Large:** Sizes range from 10⁵ to 10⁷ unknowns, typical of modern industrial applications. 🏗️
    *   **Sparse:** The majority of entries in $A$ are zero. 🕸️
    *   **Often Nonsymmetric:** This arises from various reasons such as the multiphysics nature of PDEs, sophisticated boundary or jump conditions, or the discretization methods themselves (e.g., convection-diffusion equations, Petrov-Galerkin methods). 🔄

---

*   **Why Iterative Methods?**
    *   Direct methods (e.g., Cholesky decomposition, Gaussian elimination) are often too computationally expensive and memory-intensive for large, sparse systems. 💸
    *   Iterative methods, like Krylov subspace methods, find approximate solutions incrementally, reducing computational and storage costs. ⏳

---

### KSP: Building Blocks for Solutions 🧱✨

*   **Definition:** The $k$-th Krylov subspace $K_k(A,v)$ generated by matrix $A$ and vector $v$ is:
    *   $K_k(A,v) = \text{span}\{v, Av, A^2v, \ldots, A^{k-1}v\}$
    *   To solve $Ax=b$, $v$ is typically the initial residual $r_0 = b - Ax_0$.
*   **How they work:**
    *   KSP methods incrementally find approximate solutions within $K_k(A,v)$. 🔄
    *   They avoid explicit matrix formation by primarily relying on matrix-vector products, enabling "matrix-free" methods. 🎯
*   **Popular KSP Methods for Nonsymmetric Systems:**
    *   GMRES 🏆
    *   TFQMR 🚀
    *   BiCGSTAB ⚡
    *   QMRCGSTAB 🌟

---

*   **Core Iteration Procedures:**
    *   **Arnoldi Iteration:** Constructs an *orthogonal* basis for $K_k(A,v)$.
        *   The KSP method GMRES is based on Arnoldi iteration.
        *   Has a $k$-term recurrence, meaning computational cost increases with $k$. 📉
        *   Often requires restarts (e.g., GMRES(30)) to manage cost, which can unfortunately undermine convergence. ⚠️
    *   **Bi-Lanczos Iteration:** Offers an alternative for constructing basis.
        *   Enjoys a *three-term recurrence*, meaning fixed computational cost per iteration. 💰
        *   Requires two matrix-vector multiplications per iteration, but the basis is *not orthogonal*. 🔄
        *   Used by methods like BiCG and QMR, and their transpose-free variants (TFQMR, BiCGSTAB, QMRCGSTAB).
        *   Can suffer from breakdown, though this is rare in practice. ⚠️

---

### The Power of Preconditioning 🚀💡

*   **Why are Preconditioners Needed?**
    *   The convergence of KSP methods can be improved significantly by using preconditioners.
    *   The effectiveness of Krylov methods heavily depends on the *conditioning* of the matrix $A$. Ill-conditioned matrices lead to slow convergence. 🐌
*   **What is a Preconditioner (M)?**
    *   A matrix or transformation $M$ whose inverse $M^{-1}$ *approximates* the inverse of $A$ ($A^{-1}$).
    *   The application of $M^{-1}$ to a vector must be computationally efficient.
*   **Goal of Preconditioning:**
    *   To transform the original system $Ax=b$ into an equivalent system (e.g., $M^{-1}Ax = M^{-1}b$ or $AM^{-1}y=b$) such that the preconditioned matrix ($M^{-1}A$ or $AM^{-1}$) has a **smaller condition number** than $A$.
    *   A smaller condition number directly translates to a faster rate of convergence for iterative solvers. 🚀

---

*   **Types of Preconditioning (for nonsymmetric systems):**
    *   **Left Preconditioning:** Solve $M^{-1}Ax = M^{-1}b$.
        *   The convergence criterion is typically based on the preconditioned residual $‖M^{-1}r_k‖$.
        *   This can differ significantly from the *true residual* $‖r_k‖$ if $‖M^{-1}‖$ is far from 1, leading to **false stagnation** or **premature termination**. ⚠️
    *   **Right Preconditioning (Recommended) 👍:** Solve $AM^{-1}y = b$, then $x = M^{-1}y$.
        *   The crucial advantage is that it **does not alter the true residual** $r_k$.
        *   The stopping criteria can use $‖r_k‖$ with little or no extra computational cost.
        *   This makes right preconditioning generally **more reliable** for large-scale systems. ✅
    *   **Two-Sided/Symmetric Preconditioning:** Involves applying preconditioners to both sides (e.g., $QAP^{-1}(Px) = Qb$). While it can preserve symmetry for symmetric matrices, it also alters the norm of the residual for nonsymmetric matrices. 🔄

### Our Toolkit: A Look at Preconditioner Families 🧰🌈

We systematically compared KSP methods with three classes of state-of-the-art preconditioners:

*   **Gauss-Seidel (GS)** 🔄:
    *   One of the simplest stationary iterative methods.
    *   Easy to implement and requires virtually no setup time (in serial).
    *   Parameter-free (when the relaxation parameter $\omega = 1$).
    *   **Limitation:** Requires nonzero diagonal entries in $A$.
    *   Generally outperformed by ILU0 for the tested large linear systems.

---

*   **Incomplete LU (ILU) Factorization** 🏗️:
    *   Performs an approximate factorization $A \approx \tilde{L}\tilde{U}$, where $\tilde{L}$ and $\tilde{U}$ are much sparser than full LU factors.
    *   **Variants studied:**
        *   **ILU0 / ILU(0):** Simplest form, introduces no fill-in, preserving $A$'s sparsity pattern.
        *   **ILUT:** (ILU with dual thresholding) Extends ILU(k) by preserving fills based on levels and thresholding numerical values.
        *   **ILUTP:** (ILU with partial pivoting) Mitigates breakdown issues when $A$ has zeros on the diagonal (common in saddle-point problems).
            *   **Drawback:** Number of nonzeros in $\tilde{L}$ and $\tilde{U}$ can grow super-linearly with matrix size, leading to super-linear growth in setup and solve times for very large systems.
        *   **Multilevel ILU (MILU):** Better controls the growth of nonzeros, leading to *linear* growth of setup and solve times for large sparse systems.
            *   **Key Advantage:** Succeeds for **saddle-point problems** where AMG may fail.
            *   Empirically, MILU (ILUPACK) often outperformed SuperLU's ILUTP and ILU0 for large systems.

---

*   **Algebraic Multigrid (AMG)** 🌐:
    *   The most sophisticated preconditioners, accelerating convergence by constructing a series of coarser representations.
    *   More expensive than GS and ILU in terms of setup time and per-iteration cost, but offer significantly faster convergence.
    *   **Types studied:**
        *   **Classical AMG:** Implemented by BoomerAMG (part of HYPRE). Uses "classical coarsening" strategies.
        *   **Smoothed Aggregation:** Implemented by ML. Coarsening is done by accumulating aggregates.
    *   **BoomerAMG Tuning (Crucial for 3D problems):**
        *   BoomerAMG offers various **coarsening strategies** (Falgout, PMIS, HMIS) and **interpolation techniques** (classical, extended+classical, FF1).
        *   Falgout coarsening is good for 2D, but less efficient for 3D. PMIS and HMIS significantly improve memory and runtime for 3D problems.
        *   FF1 interpolation performed better than extended+classical interpolation with HMIS/PMIS coarsening.
    *   **Limitation:** Both AMG methods may **fail** for some cases, especially for saddle-point-like problems (matrices with many zero diagonal entries).

### KSP Methods: Trade-offs & Mechanics ⚙️🔧

| Method     | Basis Construction       | Mat-Vec Products (per iter.) | Recurrence Type | Storage (vectors) 
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- 
| **GMRES**  | Arnoldi (orthogonal)     | 1 ($AM^{-1}$)                    | $k$-term        | $k + 5$
| **BiCGSTAB** | Transpose-free Bi-Lanczos (non-orthogonal) | 2 ($AM^{-1}$)                    | 3-term          | $10$
| **TFQMR**  | Same as BiCGSTAB | 2 ($AM^{-1}$)                    | 3-term          | $8$
| **QMRCGSTAB** | Same as BiCGSTAB | 2 ($AM^{-1}$)                    | 3-term          | $13$

---

*   **Computational Cost & Convergence Rate:**
    *   While GMRES requires one matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and the other methods require two, the reduction of error in one iteration of a bi-Lanczos-based KSP method is approximately equal to that of two iterations in an Arnoldi-based KSP method. Therefore, the costs of these methods are **comparable** in terms of the number of matrix-vector multiplications required to achieve similar error reduction.
    *   GMRES, minimizing the 2-norm of the residual, *can* converge faster in terms of matrix-vector multiplications, especially with an effective preconditioner. 🚀

*   **Robustness Considerations:**
    *   Theoretically, Arnoldi iteration is more robust due to its use of an orthogonal basis, but restarts can undermine convergence.
    *   Bi-Lanczos iterations may break down if $v_{k+1}^T w_{k+1} = 0$, but this is rare in practice, especially with a good preconditioner.
    *   **Crucially, effective preconditioners can overcome many of the inherent disadvantages of each KSP method**, leading to smooth and rapid convergence.

### Choosing the Best Method: Recommendations from Empirical Study ✅

Our systematic comparison across 16 large-scale nonsymmetric linear systems (up to 10⁷ unknowns) derived from various PDE discretizations (FEM, AES-FEM, GFD, FDM, DG, Mixed FEM, Stokes) provides the following practical guidelines:

---

*  **Primary Recommendation: For Very Large, Reasonably Well-Conditioned Linear Systems**
    *   **Use GMRES with Classical AMG as a Right Preconditioner**.
        *   **Why?** GMRES (without restart) minimizes the $L2$ norm of the residual, and with an effective AMG, it converges quickly, keeping the cost of orthogonalization low.
        *   **AMG Tuning is CRITICAL (especially for 3D problems):**
            *   For BoomerAMG (classical AMG, e.g., in HYPRE), the most robust option found was **HMIS coarsening with FF1 interpolation**. This combination outperforms PMIS+FF1 for ill-conditioned systems and significantly outperforms smoothed-aggregation AMG (ML).
            *   AMG-preconditioned KSP methods exhibit **nearly linear asymptotic growth** ($slope ≈ 1$) in runtime with respect to problem size, making them highly scalable for very large problems.

---

*  **Secondary Recommendation: If AMG is Unavailable or Fails (e.g., Saddle-Point Problems)**
    *   **Use BiCGSTAB with Multilevel ILU (MILU) as a Right Preconditioner**.
        *   **Why MILU?** It effectively controls fill-in, leading to nearly linear growth of setup and solve times, making it suitable for large sparse systems. Crucially, MILU succeeds for **saddle-point-like problems** (matrices with many zero diagonal entries), where AMG methods may fail.
        *   **Why BiCGSTAB?** Without an effective AMG, BiCGSTAB typically outperforms GMRES and is often more efficient and robust than restarted GMRES.
        *   **Alternative:** If MILU is unavailable (e.g., in PETSc), ILUTP (e.g., in SuperLU or MATLAB's built-in $ilu$ function) can be used for moderate-sized systems, as it also handles saddle-point problems. However, ILUTP's setup times may grow super-linearly for very large problems.

---

*  **General Principle: Prioritize Right Preconditioning**
    *   **Right preconditioning is generally more reliable** than left preconditioning for large-scale systems.
    *   It ensures that the stopping criteria based on the residual norm $‖r_k‖$ accurately reflect the true error, preventing misleading convergence behavior like false stagnation or premature termination.
    *   **Recommendation:** When using software like PETSc, *explicitly set the option to use right preconditioning*, as left preconditioning is often the default.

### AI for Solvers: Graph Neural Preconditioners ???🤔

*   **Concept:** A novel approach proposing to use **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to learn and approximate the matrix inverse $A^{-1}$ (which serves as the preconditioner $M$).
*   **Motivation:** Inspired by the universal approximation property of neural networks and their widespread success in artificial intelligence.
*   **Why GNNs?** A sparse matrix $A$ can be naturally interpreted as a graph adjacency matrix. GNNs leverage this graph structure, performing convolutions in node neighborhoods, which is well-suited for sparse matrices.
*   **Integration with Krylov Solvers:** Since $M$ (the GNN) is a *nonlinear* operator ??? 🤔, standard Krylov subspace theory (which relies on linearity) breaks down. Thus, GNP is used with **Flexible GMRES (FGMRES)**.
    *   FGMRES is designed to accommodate preconditioners that change (or are nonlinear) in each Arnoldi step.

---

*   **Key Technical Contributions & Innovations:**
    1.  **Convergence Analysis for FGMRES with Nonlinear $M$:** Provides a novel *a posteriori* analysis. The residual $r_m$ is bounded by:
        *   $‖r_m‖_2 \le \kappa_2(\mathbf{X})\epsilon^{(m)}(\mathbf{\Lambda})‖r_0‖_2 + ‖\mathbf{Q}_m\mathbf{Q}_m^{\top} - \widetilde{\mathbf{Q}}_m\widetilde{\mathbf{Q}}_m^{\top}‖_2‖r_0‖_2$
        *   The second term highlights the impact of the nonlinear preconditioner, showing how closely the subspace generated by the GNN ($\mathbf{Q}_m$) matches that of an ideal linear preconditioner ($\widetilde{\mathbf{Q}}_m$).
    2.  **Effective Training Data Generation:**
        *   Addresses the challenge of sampling $x$ such that $b=Ax$ covers important spectral information (especially the bottom eigen-subspace).
        *   Samples $x$ from a mixture of $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{\Sigma}_m^{\mathbf{x}})$ (derived from Arnoldi process for extreme eigenvectors) and $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}_n)$ (uniform sphere coverage). This mix balances ease of training with preconditioner.
    3.  **Scale-Equivariant GNN Architecture:**
        *   Introduces a parameter-free scaling $s(\cdot) = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\tau}\cdot$ and corresponding back-scaling $s^{-1}(\cdot) = \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{n}}\cdot$, where $\tau = ‖b‖_2$.
        *   This design imposes an inductive bias that ensures **scale-equivariance** ($\mathbf{M}(\alpha\mathbf{b})=\alpha\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{b})$ for $\alpha \neq 0$), facilitating training when input $b$ vectors have vastly different scales.

---

*   **Performance Highlights (Evaluated on >800 SuiteSparse matrices):**
    *   **Superior for Ill-Conditioned Problems:** Particularly effective for matrices with condition numbers $\geq 10^{16}$.
    *   **High Robustness:** GNP exhibited very few failures (0.12% solution failures, 0% construction failures), significantly outperforming ILU (40% construction failures) and AMG (7% construction failures).
    *   **Predictable Construction Time:** The GNN training time is nearly proportional to the matrix size, offering a much more predictable cost than ILU and AMG setup times, which can be highly erratic.
    *   **Faster Execution:** GNP can be significantly faster than using GMRES as an inner preconditioner.

---

### Horizon: What's Next for Solvers? 🔭🚀

*   **Current Study Limitations:**
    *   The study primarily focused on serial performance and did not include comparisons of parallel performance or asymptotic complexity with respect to the number of cores.
    *   Did not include comparisons with geometric multigrid (GMG) methods, which can sometimes outperform AMG.
    *   Did not address the solution of nonsymmetric, rank-deficient linear systems, a challenging problem in its own right.

---

*   **Future Avenues for Graph Neural Preconditioners (GNP):**
    1.  **SPD Matrices:** Extend GNP to symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. While flexible CG exists, flexible preconditioners can be fragile. Exploring split preconditioners or autoencoder networks might offer more robust solutions.
    2.  **Sequential Problems & Continual Learning:** Adapt GNP for sequences of evolving matrices, common in time-stepping or sequential problems. Continual learning can amortize the initial preconditioner construction cost by continuously adapting the GNN for slowly evolving data distributions.
    3.  **Scaling to Larger Matrices:** Current GPU memory limits restrict matrix size and network complexity. Future work can explore multi-GPU and distributed training of GNNs, potentially using neighborhood sampling to mitigate the "neighborhood explosion" problem in GNNs for larger graphs.
    4.  **Hyperparameter Optimization & Architecture Improvement:** While the reported results used a fixed set of hyperparameters, significant performance improvements are expected with problem-specific tuning and advances in GNN architectures.

### Key Takeaways for Iterative Solver Success 🎯

*   **Preconditioners are Essential:** They are indispensable for achieving efficient and robust convergence of Krylov subspace methods when solving large, sparse linear systems.
*   **Right Preconditioning is Key:** Always prefer right preconditioning to ensure that convergence criteria accurately reflect the true residual, thereby avoiding false stagnation or premature termination.
*   **Primary Recommendation:** For large, reasonably well-conditioned linear systems, the most efficient method is often **GMRES coupled with a Classical Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioner**, particularly BoomerAMG with HMIS coarsening and FF1 interpolation. AMG's near-linear scalability offers significant advantages for increasing problem sizes.
*   **Secondary Recommendation:** If AMG is unavailable or if the problem involves **saddle-point-like matrices** (with many zero diagonal entries), **BiCGSTAB with Multilevel ILU (MILU) as a right preconditioner** is a robust and effective alternative.
*   **Emerging AI-Driven Solutions:** **Graph Neural Preconditioners (GNP)** represent a promising new direction ??? 🤔.
