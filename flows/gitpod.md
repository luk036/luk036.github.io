# GitPod = GitHub + üêß Linux + VSCode

@luk036

---

## Why GitPod.io?

-   Remote working environment for software development
-   Development on the go
-   Cloud-based development
-   Remote access to a (virtual) üêß Linux machine (docker's container)
    that has a 16-core CPU and 60 GB RAM!
-   The only requirements:
    -   a web browser (better Chrome or Firefox)
    -   an internet connection
    -   a GitHub/GitLab account

---

## Technologies

-   Gitpod's IDE is based on Eclipse Foundation's Theia, the same as VSCode.
-   Experimental support of VSCode's extensions.
-   Integrate with GitHub repositories.
-   Docker's container as a virtual üêß Linux machine.
-   Prebuilt Docker image contains basic software development tools such as:
    -   g++-8, clang++-10, python2, python3, gdb, npm, CMake, make
-   More advanced images may include VNC or database facilities.

---

## Custom Configuration

-   You may customize you own image build to make even more
    functionality, by modifying the `.gitpod.yml` file and `Dockerfile`.

-   For example:

    -   [jupyter lab](https://github.com/jins-tkomoda/dash-and-jupyter-notebook-with-gitpod)
    -   [conda](https://github.com/mtvu/miniconda)
    -   [latex + pandoc](https://github.com/luk036/ellipsoid-method)

---

## More examples

-   C++ plus Conda
-   Python plus Jupyter
-   Pandoc + LaTeX

## Potential Usages üöß

-   Evaluate large open source GitHub/GitLab repos.
-   Perform benchmarking of large benchmarks
-   Perform Sanitizer analysis, static code analysis
-   Writing Undergraduate thesis via Pandoc
-   Writing paper via Pandoc + LaTeX
-   Hardware design simulation. EDA on the cloud.

---

## Limitations üò≠

-   Unused workspaces are automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity.
-   Only 50hrs/month, 4 parallel workspaces, public repos for free plan.
-   No Windows or macOS build, only üêß Linux.
-   Graphical output must be through VNC or JupyterLab. No sound.
-   No GPU support.
