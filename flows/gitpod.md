# GitPod = Github + Linux + VSCode

## @luk036

---

## Why GitPod.io?

- Remote working environment for software development
- Development on the go
- Cloud-based development
- Remote access to a (virtual) Linux machine (docker's container) that has a 16-core CPU and 60GB RAM!
- The only requirements:
    - a web browser (better Chrome or Firefox)
    - an internet connection
    - a github/gitlab account

---

## Technologies

- GitPod's IDE is based on Eclipse Foundation's Theia, the same as VSCode.
- Experimental support of VSCode's extensions.
- Integrate with GitHub repositories.
- Docker's container as a virtual Linux machine.
 - Prebuilt Docker image contains basic software development tools such as:
 - g++-8, clang++-10, python2, python3, gdb, npm, CMake, make
 - More advanced images may include VNC or database facilities.

---

## Custom Configuration

- You may customize you own image build to make even more functionality, by modifying the `.gitpod.yml` file and `Dockerfile`.

- For example:
    - [jupyter lab](https://github.com/jins-tkomoda/dash-and-jupyter-notebook-with-gitpod)
    - [conda](https://github.com/mtvu/miniconda)
    - [latex + pandoc](https://github.com/luk036/ellipsoid-method)

---

## More examples

- C++ plus Conda
- Python plus Jupyter
- Pandoc + LaTeX

## Potential Usages üöß

- Evaluate large opensource github/gitlab repos. 
- Perform benchmarking of large benchmarks
- Perform Sanitizer analysis, static code analysis
- Writing Undergraduate thesis via Pandoc
- Writing paper via Pandoc + LaTeX
- Hardware design simulation. EDA on the cloud.

---

## Limitations üò≠

- Unused workspaces are automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity.
- Only 100hrs/month, 4 parallel workspaces, public repos for free plan.
- No Windows or MacOS build, only Linux.
- Graphical output must be through VNC or JupyterLab. No sound.
- No GPU support.
- Debugging with IDE is not working ü§î
