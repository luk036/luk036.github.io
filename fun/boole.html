# Algebra of Boole

Usual Story
------------

-   Boolean Algebra ({0,1}, &, |)  (George Boole 1847)
-   Boolean function (logic expression): f = x ⋅ (y | (x ⋅ ¬z))
-   Canonical forms:
    -   sum-of-product: ¬x ⋅ y ⋅ ¬z | x ⋅ ¬y ⋅ z | x ⋅ y ⋅ ¬z
    -   product-of-sum: (x | ¬y | z) ⋅ (~x | y | ¬z) ⋅ (~x | ¬y | z)
-   Logic minimization, Espresso
-   Logic synthesis, BDD
-   Formal verification

-   What we believed: ⋅ (AND), | (OR), ¬ (NEG) are the only building block of logic.

---

"New" Story - XOR centric
-----------------------------

-   In fact, George Boole at first suggested to use ({0,1}, &, +) as his algebra system, but then gave up later for some unknown reason.

-   f = 1 + a + a ⋅ b + a ⋅ b ⋅ c

-   Boolean algebra is more intuitive for humans🚶, but computers are not humans🚶.

-   In fact ancient geeks also use Boole's algebra.

---

Why XOR?
---------

-   XOR gate can be implemented effectively using *Pass-Transistor Logic* (PTL)

-   5~6 transistors. Good for both power and delay.

-   It has already successfully been used in for example full adder, encryption processor, Gray code encoder/decoder etc.

-   Pass-Transistor Logic is relatively expensive for simple monotonic gates such as NAND and NOR (Zimmermann and Fichtner 1997).

-   CMOS + PTL = CPL

-   In fact, **all Boolean functions can be implemented using simply XOR-AND-NEG gates without OR gates**.

---

Challenges
----------

-   Lack of supporting EDA tools. Almost need to redo everything.
-   Zhegalkin Polynomials

Truth Table

 | x   | y   | f   |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | 0   | 0   | 1   |
 | 0   | 1   | 0   |
 | 1   | 0   | 1   |
 | 1   | 1   | 0   |
