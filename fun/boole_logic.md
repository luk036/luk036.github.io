# MF151 A brief history of logic: Aristotle and deduction

---

## A brief foray into 'philosophy'

**logic** ‚âà the study of valid techniques of inference,
or drawing conclusions from premises

Early schools of Indian & Chinese
logic In ancient Greece, Zeno (490-430 B.C.E)
& Parmenides used 'reduc absurdum' arguments,
and  'de; involing

---

## Plato (428-348 B.C.E.)

- student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle, and
  the founder of modern philosophy &

---

## Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.)

- tutor of Alexander the Greate
- wrote on biology, physics, metaphysics,
  poetry, ethics, psychology, linguistics,
  economics, ... and **logic**

The Organon - 6 books on logic.
 mature influential works from the
 initiator of the subject.

---

## Modern statement: (sets)

'If every B is an A, and
    every C is a B, then
    every C is an A.'

 $A a B$; $B a C \implies A a C$

## Aristotle's statement: (types)

'If A belongs to all B, and
    B belongs to all C, then
    A belongs to all C.'

 ???

---

## Four logical forms [Propositions]

A a B: 'A belongs to  all B', or 'Every B is an A'
A e B: 'A belongs to   no B', or 'No    B is an A'
A i B: 'A belongs to some B', or 'Some  B is an A'
A o B: 'A does not belong to some B' or
           'Some B is not an A'

---

Syllogism: "discourse in which certain
things being stated, something else follows"
        Premise 1 + Premise 2 $\implies$ Conclusion
 $A a B$, $B a C ‚ä¢ A a C$     $B$

---

A e B, A a C ‚ä¢ B e C      Cesare
A a B, A e C ‚ä¢ B e C      Camestres
A e B, A i C ‚ä¢ B o C      Festino
A a B, A o C ‚ä¢ B o C      Baroco

Ex. All informative things are useful. Some
   books are not useful

---

Aristotle did not write on maths.
But he discussed 'infinity': distinguished
between 'potential' & 'actual' infinity.
Wrote  that mathenaticians 'do not
  need infinity or use it.'

Plato: there are 2 worlds, real & ideal
Aristotle: there is only 1 world, with
matter & form

# MF252: A brief history of logic

---

Zeno's logic was influenced by the
Megarians: perception => assent =>

---

Aristotle's logic: All A ("subject') are B ("predicate")
    A B terms:
  Stoic logic:
   - If p then q [implication]
   - Both p and q [conjunction]
   - Either p or q [disjunction]
         p, q propositions  (logical connectives)

- Exclusive "or": night or day
						  red or flat ???

---

## The five indemonstrable forms

- If p then q; p; therefore q (Modus Ponens)
- If p then q; p; not q; ‚à¥ not p (Modus Tollens)
- not (p and q); p; ‚à¥ not q
- **Either p or q; p; ‚à¥ not q**
- Either p or q; not p; ‚à¥ q

---

## The "law of excluded middle"

Q. Is the statement 'p or not p' necessarily true?
A. It depends who you ask!

Aristotle: p: A sea battle will take place tomorrow
          not p: A sea battle will not take place tomorrow
Is 'p or not p' true today?

---

The Stoics leaned towards dterminism [limited "free will"]

| p   | not p |
| --- | :---: |
| T   |   F   |
| F   |   T   |

| p   | q   |  ???  |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| T   | T   |   ?   |
| T   | F   |   ?   |
| F   | T   |   ?   |
| F   | F   |   ?   |

---

## The temporal aspect of 'truth'

If the statement 'It is warm today'
is true, will it retain its truth for ever (i.e. in 6 months)?
We tend to new statements as
' , so truth is maintained.
Stotic

| p   | q   | If p then q |
| --- | --- | :---------: |
| T   | T   |      T      |
| T   | F   |      F      |
| F   | T   |      T      |
| F   | F   |      T      |

The Stoic & modern interpretations agree.

---

## The Megarian school of philosophy

Founded by Euclides of Megara,
followed by Ichthyas & Stilpo [4th
 century B.C.E.] ‚Üí influenced Stoics
 Diodorus: what is possible is limited
 to what is, or will be true in the future
 the nature of 'truth'?
Sadly the Stoics/Megarian way
  decline till recently.

## The nature of implication

'If p then q'

1. Every p is a q ‚ü∫  p q = p (Leibniz!)
Ex. If h = (1,1,1,1,0) and a = (1,0,1,0,0)
then every athlete is a human, i.e.
whenever a(i) = 1, h(i)=1. So
   a ‚ãÖ h = (1,0,1,0,0) ‚ãÖ (1,1,1,1,0) = (1,0,1,0,0) = a

2. No p is a q ‚ü∫  p q = 0
Ex. If n = (0,1,0,0,1)
then no athlete is noble, i.e.
whenever a(i) = 1, n(i)=0. So
   a n = (1,0,1,0,0) ‚ãÖ (0,1,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,0,0) = 0

---

3. Some p is a q ‚ü∫  p q != 0
Ex. If h = (1,1,1,1,0) and n = (0,1,0,0,1)
then some human is noble, i.e. for some i,
h(i) = a(i) = 1, h(i) = 1, namely i = 2. So
   h n = (1,1,1,1,0) ‚ãÖ (0,1,0,0,1) = (0,1,0,0,0) != 0

4. Some p is not a q ‚ü∫  p (1 + q) != 0
Ex. Some human is not noble since
   h (1 + n) = (1,1,1,1,0) ‚ãÖ (1,0,1,1,0) = (1,0,1,1,0) != 0

# MF277: A systematic approach to logic deduction, & the Boole-Mobius transform

A more sophisticated deduction

---

First step: convert all statements into Bool polynumbers

X == (A | B) ‚Üí (C ‚Üî A) = 1 + A + A C + B C + A B C
Y == (A i

---

X == (A | B) ‚Üí (C ‚Üî A) = (A + B + A B) ‚Üí (1 + C + A)
  = 1 + (A + B + AB) + (A + B + AB)(1 + C + A)
  = 1 + AC + BC + ABC + A + AB + AB
  = 1 + A + AC + BC + ABC

Second step: verify that
  (P1)(P2)(P3) ‚Üí Con = 1

---

So now the argument is

X   1 + A + AC + BC + ABC
Y   A + B + C + AC

---

This Algebra of Boole procedure
is especially suited for computer
calculation [augmented by Boole
reduction!]
But by hand, it can be onerous!
Fortunately there is a second
method, which uses the

  Boole Mobius transform

---

(1 + A + AC + BC + ABC)(A + B + C + AC + BC)
x(1 + B + C + BC + ABC)
= (B + C + AB)(1 + B + C + BC + ABC)
= ABC
So now we need simplify
ABC ‚Üí (1 + C + BC)

---

This Algebra of Boole procedure
achieves Leibniz's dream: to find
a purly mathematical method for
verifying reasoning

In a nutshell - after converting to
Algebra of Boole, we simpikfy
  (P1)(P2)(P3)(Pn) ‚Üí Con = 1

# MF279: The Holy Grail of Propositional Logic

Aristotle, the Stoics, Leibniz, Boole:

How to (mechanically) systematize
logical reasoning?

   Algebra of Boole

A logic problem for Sir Galahad:
Knight of the golden road: This road leads
to the grail. Also if the stones take you
there, so does the marble road.
Knight of the marble road: Neither the
gold stone roads lead to the grail.

---

$G$: the gold road leads to the grail
$M$: the marble road leads to the grail
$G$: the stone road leads to the grail

Premises:

 $X = \neg(G \land (S \to M))$
 $Y = \neg(\neg G \land \neg S)$
 $Z = \neg(G \land \neg M)$

---

## Converting to the Algebra of Boole

 $X = \neg(G \land (S \to M))$
 $  = 1 + G (1 + S + S M)
 $  = 1 + G + G S + G S M

 $Y = \neg(\neg G \land \neg S)$

---

## A) Using Bool reduction

Product (conjunction) of premises:

X Y Z = (1 + G + G S + G M S)(G + S + G S)(1 + G + G M)
      = (1 + G + G S + G M S)(S + G S + G M) = S + G S

So X Y Z \to G = (S + G S) \to G = 1 + S + G S
   X Y Z \to M = ...

---

## B) Using the Boole-Mobius transform

S M G : ordering 1,G,M,GM,S,GS,MS,GMS

X = 1 + G + G S + G M S = (1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1)
Y = ...

---

For efficiency, we apply to X,Y,Z,G,M,S

(1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1) (1 )
(0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0) (0 )
(1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0) (0 )
(0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0) (0 )
(0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0) (0 )
(0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0) (0 )

  (1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0) X
  (0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1) Y
= (1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1) Z

## The recursive aspect of the B-M transform

(a, b) (1 1) = (a, a + b)

(1 1) = T1
(0 1)

(a, b, c, d) (1 1 1 1) = (a, a+b, a+c, a+b+c+d)
             (0 1 0 1)
             (0 0 1 1)
             (0 0 0 1)
or

(u, v) T2 = (u T1, u T1 + v T1) = (u T1, (u+v) T1)

---

## The recursive aspect of the B-M transform (II)

More generally, if u, v are Boole
vectors of length 2^n, then

  (u, v) T_{n+1} = (u T_{n}, (u+v) T_{n})

Ex. X T_{3} = (1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1) T_{3}
   = ( (1,1,0,0) T_{2}, (1,0,0,1) T_{2})
   = ...
