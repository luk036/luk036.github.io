# 🧠 MF151 A brief history of logic: Aristotle and deduction 📜

---

A brief foray into 'philosophy' 🏛️ and
the role of 'logic' 🧩. The main thesis:

    Logic historically belongs
    to philosophy, not mathematics! 🤔➗

Aristotle, deduction, syllogisms (1)
and the birth of logic. 🍼

---

## A brief foray into 'philosophy' 🏛️

**logic** ≈ the study of valid techniques
of **inference** 🧐, or drawing
conclusions from premises 📝

Early schools of Indian 🇮🇳 & Chinese 🇨🇳 
logic In ancient Greece, Zeno (490-430 B.C.E) 🏛️
& Parmenides used 'reductio ad absurdum' arguments,
and developed 'dialectic'; involving
paradoxes. 🤯

---

## Plato (428-348 B.C.E.) 🏛️

- student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle, and
  the founder of modern philosophy & great writer. ✍️

  _ethics_⚖️/_politics_🏛️/_metaphysics_ (duality) &
  _epistemology_ (study of knowledge) 🧠

- Q. What is the nature of '_true_' & '_false_'? ✅❌
- Q. What is the connection between
  _premises_ & _conclusions_? 🔗
  What is the nature of _definition_? 📖

---

## Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) 🏛️

- tutor of Alexander the Great 👑
- wrote on biology 🧬, physics 🌌, metaphysics,
  poetry 📜, ethics ⚖️, psychology 🧠, linguistics 🗣️,
  economics 💰, ... and **logic** 🧩

The Organon 📚 - 6 books on logic.
mature influential works from the
initiator of the subject. 🏛️

---

- Modern statement: (sets) 🧮

'If every B is an A, and
every C is an B, then
every C is an A.'
A a B \text{and} B a C \implies A a C

- Aristotle's statement: (types) 📜

If A belongs to all B, and
B belongs to all C, then
A belongs to all C.

---

## Four logical forms [Propositions] 📝

A a B: 'A belongs to all B', or 'Every B is an A' ✅
A e B: 'A belongs to no B', or 'No B is an A' ❌
A i B: 'A belongs to some B', or 'Some B is an A' 🔍
A o B: 'A does not belong to some B' or
'Some B is not an A' 🚫

---

Syllogism: "discourse in which certain
things being stated, something else follows" 🔄
Premise 1 + Premise 2 \implies Conclusion 📝
A a B, B a C ⊢ A a C Barbara
A e B, B a C ⊢ A e C Celaremt
A a B, B i C ⊢ A i C Darii
A e B, B a C ⊢ A o C Ferio

Ex. 🏋️: All owls 🦉 have big eyes 👀. Some hunters 🏹 are owls 🦉
\therefore some hunters 🏹 have big eyes 👀. (Darii)

---

A e B, A a C ⊢ B e C Cesare
A a B, A e C ⊢ B e C Camestres
A e B, A i C ⊢ B o C Festino
A a B, A o C ⊢ B o C Baroco

Ex. 🏋️: All informative things are useful. Some
books 📚 are not useful. \therefore Some books 📚
are not informative. ℹ️
Ex. 🏋️: All fish🐟 have gills. No humans🚶 have gills.
\therefore No humans🚶 are fish🐟. 🧠

---

Aristotle did not write on maths ➗. 
But he discussed 'infinity' ♾️: distinguished
between 'potential' & 'actual' infinity.
Wrote that mathematicians 'do not
need infinity or use it.'

Plato: there are 2 worlds 🌎🌍, real & ideal
Aristotle: there is only 1 world 🌍, with
matter & form

# 🧠 MF252: A brief history of logic 📜

---

Zeno's logic was influenced by the
Megarians: perception 👀 => assent 👍=>

---

Aristotle's logic: All A ("subject') are B ("predicate")
A B terms:
Stoic logic:

- If p then q [implication] ➡️
- Both p and q [conjunction] ∧
- Either p or q [disjunction] ∨
  p, q propositions (logical connectives) 🧩

- Exclusive "or": night 🌙 or day ☀️
  red 🔴 or flat ???

---

## The five indemonstrable forms 📝

- If p then q; p; therefore q (Modus Ponens) ✅
- If p then q; p; not q; ∴ not p (Modus Tollens) ❌
- not (p and q); p; ∴ not q
- **Either p or q; p; ∴ not q**
- Either p or q; not p; ∴ q

---

## The "law of excluded middle" ⚖️

Q. Is the statement 'p or not p' necessarily true? 🤔
A. It depends who you ask! 🗣️

Aristotle: p: A sea battle ⚔️ will take place tomorrow
not p: A sea battle ⚔️ will not take place tomorrow
Is 'p or not p' true today? ⏳

---

The Stoics leaned towards determinism [limited "free will"] 🧵

| p   | not p |
| --- | :---: |
| T   |   F   |
| F   |   T   |

| p   | q   | ??? |
| --- | --- | :-: |
| T   | T   |  ?  |
| T   | F   |  ?  |
| F   | T   |  ?  |
| F   | F   |  ?  |

---

## The temporal aspect of 'truth' ⏳

If the statement 'It is warm today' ☀️
is true, will it retain its truth for ever (i.e. in 6 months)? ❄️
We tend to new statements as
' , so truth is maintained.
Stotic

| p   | q   | If p then q |
| --- | --- | :---------: |
| T   | T   |      T      |
| T   | F   |      F      |
| F   | T   |      T      |
| F   | F   |      T      |

The Stoic & modern interpretations agree. 🤝

---

## The Megarian school of philosophy 🏛️

Founded by Euclides of Megara,
followed by Ichthyas & Stilpo [4th
century B.C.E.] → influenced Stoics
Diodorus: what is possible is limited
to what is, or will be true in the future
the nature of 'truth'? 🤔
Sadly the Stoics/Megarian way
decline till recently. 📉

B(5,2) = {(b1,b2,b3,b4,b5): bi ∈ B2, i=1,2,3,4,5}
Point-wise operations
(b1,b2,b3,b4,b5) + (c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) ≡ (b1+c1,b2+c2,b3+c3,b4+c4,b5+c5)
(b1,b2,b3,b4,b5) ⋅ (c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) ≡ (b1⋅c1,b2⋅c2,b3⋅c3,b4⋅c4,b5⋅c5)

???
Ex. 🏋️: If h=(1,1,1,1,0), g=(0,0,1,0,1) then
h + g = (1,1,0,1,1) [h xor g] - 'exclusive or' ['Stoic or']
h ⋅ g = (0,0,1,0,0) [h and g]

---

## Properties of the bifield algebra B(5, 2) 🧮

If p, q, r ∈ B(5, 2) then
p + q = q + p
p ⋅ q = q ⋅ p
(p + q) + r = p + (q + r)
p ⋅ (q + r) = p ⋅ q + p ⋅ r
(p + q) ⋅ r = p ⋅ r + q ⋅ r

With
0 ≡ (0,0,0,0,0)
1 ≡ (1,1,1,1,1)

λ ......

---

1. Every p is a q ⟺ p q = p (Leibniz!) 🧠
   Ex. 🏋️: If h = (1,1,1,1,0) and a = (1,0,1,0,0)
   then every athlete is a human, i.e.
   whenever a(i) = 1, h(i)=1. So
   a ⋅ h = (1,0,1,0,0) ⋅ (1,1,1,1,0) = (1,0,1,0,0) = a

2. No p is a q ⟺ p q = 0
   Ex. 🏋️: If n = (0,1,0,0,1)
   then no athlete is noble, i.e.
   whenever a(i) = 1, n(i)=0. So
   a n = (1,0,1,0,0) ⋅ (0,1,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,0,0) = 0

---

3. Some p is a q ⟺ p q != 0
   Ex. 🏋️: If h = (1,1,1,1,0) and n = (0,1,0,0,1)
   then some human is noble, i.e. for some i,
   h(i) = a(i) = 1, h(i) = 1, namely i = 2. So
   h n = (1,1,1,1,0) ⋅ (0,1,0,0,1) = (0,1,0,0,0) != 0

4. Some p is not a q ⟺ p (1 + q) != 0
   Ex. 🏋️: Some human is not noble since
   h (1 + n) = (1,1,1,1,0) ⋅ (1,0,1,1,0) = (1,0,1,1,0) != 0

# 🧠 MF277: A systematic approach to logic deduction, & the Boole-Mobius transform 🔄

A more sophisticated deduction

---

First step: convert all statements into Bool polynumbers

X == (A | B) → (C ↔ A) = 1 + A + A C + B C + A B C
Y == (A i

---

X == (A | B) → (C ↔ A) = (A + B + A B) → (1 + C + A)
= 1 + (A + B + AB) + (A + B + AB)(1 + C + A)
= 1 + AC + BC + ABC + A + AB + AB
= 1 + A + AC + BC + ABC

Second step: verify that
(P1)(P2)(P3) → Con = 1

---

So now the argument is

X 1 + A + AC + BC + ABC
Y A + B + C + AC

---

This Algebra of Boole procedure
is especially suited for computer 💻
calculation [augmented by Boole
reduction!]
But by hand, it can be onerous! 😫
Fortunately there is a second
method, which uses the

Boole Mobius transform 🔄

---

(1 + A + AC + BC + ABC)(A + B + C + AC + BC)
x(1 + B + C + BC + ABC)
= (B + C + AB)(1 + B + C + BC + ABC)
= ABC
So now we need simplify
ABC → (1 + C + BC)

---

This Algebra of Boole procedure
achieves Leibniz's dream: to find
a purely mathematical method for
verifying reasoning 🧠➗

In a nutshell - after converting to
Algebra of Boole, we simplify
(P1)(P2)(P3)(Pn) → Con = 1

G: the stone road leads to the grail 🏆

Premises:

X = ¬(G ∧ (S → M))
Y = ¬(¬ G ∧ ¬ S)
Z = ¬(G ∧ ¬ M)

## Converting to the Algebra of Boole ➗

X = ¬(G ∧ (S → M))

Y = ¬(¬ G ∧ ¬ S)

## A) Using Bool reduction

Product (conjunction) of premises:

X Y Z = (1 + G + G S + G M S)(G + S + G S)(1 + G + G M)
= (1 + G + G S + G M S)(S + G S + G M) = S + G S

So X Y Z → G = (S + G S) → G = 1 + S + G S
X Y Z → M = ...

## B) Using the Boole-Mobius transform 🔄
