# Bayesian Optimization

@luk036 👨‍💻

## 📈 Statistical problem:

- Given some experimental data (with variations and uncertainty )
- Extract statistical information (mean + correlation)
- Estimation problem
- Maximum likelihood (ML) formulation -> Maximization problem
- Non-convex
- Expectation Maximization method (EM):
  - two-stage method
- Convex-Concave Procedure:
  - iteratively solve a sequence of convex sub-problem

---

## Bayesian + Optimization

- Look for conditional probability, instead of ML
- Prior information (brief): e.g. Gaussian assumption
- nonconvex => convex
