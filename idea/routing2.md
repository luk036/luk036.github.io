# Routing

- 2-pin nets
- 3-pin nets
- table-lookup
- Clock-nets
- power/ground nets
 
Braess's paradox

## Global routing

- Wire-length driven
  - Rectilinear Steiner tree
- Timing-driven
  - Sort the nets according criticality

## Detailed routing

Consideration:
- antenna effect
- cross-talk
- congestion
- design rules

- Rip-up and reroute
