# Why I don't use Rust Recently? 🤔

---

## About Me 👨‍💻

- Researcher with experience in multiple languages
- Worked on C++ programming, EDA development, and algorithms
- Tried Rust for several projects
- Appreciate its strengths but found some challenges

---

## Agenda 📋

1. **The Good** - What Rust does well ✅
2. **The Challenges** - Where I struggle ❌
3. **Trait System** - Complexity concerns 
4. **Borrow Checker** - The learning curve
5. **Use Cases** - Where Rust shines vs struggles
6. **Conclusion** - My personal take

## The Good: Rust's Strengths ✅

```mermaid

    A[Rust Strengths] --> B[Performance 🚀]
    A --> C[Memory Safety 🛡️]
    A --> D[Package Management 📦]
    A --> E[Concurrency 🔄]
    
    B --> B1[Faster than C]
    B --> B2[Zero-cost abstractions]
    C --> C1[No GC pauses]
    C --> C2[Compile-time guarantees]
    D --> D1[cargo ecosystem]
    D --> D2[Dependency management]
```

---

## Performance Champions 🏆

**Real-world examples that impressed me:**

- `rg` (ripgrep) - Blazing fast text search
- `fd` - Simple, fast file finding
- `zed` - High-performance code editor
- `fish` shell - Fast command completion

**Benchmarks often show Rust outperforming C++**

---

## Cargo: The Gold Standard 📦

```mermaid

    "Rust Cargo" : 45
    "Node npm" : 20
    "Python pip" : 15
    "C++ vcpkg" : 10
    "Other" : 10
```

- **Dependency resolution** that just works
- **Built-in testing** and documentation
- **Cross-compilation** made easy
- **Workspace** support for monorepos

## Key Concepts That Challenge Beginners 🧩

### 🎯 Ownership & Borrowing
### 🔄 Lifetimes `<'a>`
### 📐 Traits & Generics
### 🧩 Macros
### 🔒 Concurrency Model

**You need to understand ALL of these to be productive**

---

## Trait System: Powerful but Complex ⚙️

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Trait System] --> B[Generic Programming]
    A --> C[Polymorphism]
    A --> D[Code Reuse]
    
    B --> B1[Trait Bounds]
    B --> B2[Associated Types]
    B --> B3[Higher-Ranked Traits]
    
    C --> C1[Static Dispatch]
    C --> C2[Dynamic Dispatch]
    
    D --> D1[Blanket Implementations]
    D --> D2[Derive Macros]
```

---

## Trait Implementation Challenges 🤯

```rust
trait MyTrait {
    type AssociatedType;
    fn method(&self) -> Self::AssociatedType;
}

impl<T> MyTrait for Vec<T> 
where 
    T: Clone + Debug,
{
    type AssociatedType = Vec<T>;
    fn method(&self) -> Self::AssociatedType {
        self.clone()
    }
}
```

**Complex trait bounds can become unreadable**

---

## Borrow Checker: Love-Hate Relationship 💔

```mermaid

    C -->|Fails| D[Fight Borrow Checker]
    D --> E[Add Lifetimes]

    F --> C
    C -->|Success| G[🎉 It Works!]
    
    style D fill:#ff6b6b
    style E fill:#ff6b6b
```

---

## Borrow Checker Pain Points 😫

### 🚫 **Too Restrictive**
```rust
fn process_data(data: &mut Vec<i32>) -> &i32 {
    let result = &data[0];
    data.push(42); // ❌ Compiler error!
    result
}
```

### 🔍 **Not Always Smart Enough**
```rust
fn get_or_create(map: &mut HashMap<String, String>, key: String) -> &String {
    if !map.contains_key(&key) {
        map.insert(key.clone(), String::new()); // ❌ Can't do this easily
    }
    &map[&key]
}
```

---

## Lifetime Annotations: Visualized 📊

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[&'a str] --> B[Lifetime 'a]
    C[&'b str] --> D[Lifetime 'b]
    E[Function] --> F[Lifetime Bounds]
    
    B --> G[Compiler Validation]
    D --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[✅ Memory Safe]
    G --> I[❌ Compile Error]
    
    style F fill:#ff6b6b
```

**`<'a>` - The syntax that haunts beginners' dreams**

---

## AI Assistance Limitations 🤖

### **Current State:**
- ChatGPT struggles with complex lifetime issues
- GitHub Copilot suggests incorrect borrow patterns
- AI can't reason about ownership like humans

### **Reality Check:**
```rust
// AI might suggest this:
fn bad_idea(data: &Vec<i32>) -> &i32 {
    &data[0] // ❌ Lifetime issues await
}

// When you actually need:
fn better<'a>(data: &'a Vec<i32>) -> &'a i32 {
    &data[0]
}
```

    D --> F[Overkill for many projects]
    D --> G[Worth learning regardless]
```

---

## Key Takeaways 🎯

1. **Rust is technically impressive** - performance and safety are real
2. **Steep learning curve** - traits, lifetimes, and borrow checker are challenging
3. **Not ideal for rapid iteration** - algorithm development suffers
4. **Excellent for systems programming** - embedded, kernels, performance-critical code
5. **Choose based on project needs** - not every problem needs Rust's guarantees
