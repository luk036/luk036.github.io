# Code Simplicity

---

## Define "simple"

- Well documented üìù
    - Assumptions
    - Limitations
    - Requirements
- Predictable
- Less tunable parameters (a.k.a. magic numbers)

---

## Parameter tuning

- Sometimes "necessary evil"
- Based on "environment"

---

## Simulated annealing

- Initial temperature
- Cooling rate
- Neighborhood function

---

## Numerical algorithms

- Tolerance (epsilon)
- Damped Newton's method

---

## Metropolis algorithm

- Based on "Acceptance and rejection"
- No tuning parameters

---

## Genetic algorithm

- Encoding
- Fitness function (natural selection)

---

## Reinforcement learning

- Policy gradient
- Rewarding function
- Sparse rewarding
- ...
