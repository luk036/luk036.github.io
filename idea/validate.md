# Testing in AI Era

- Validation is easier than Construction
- Test first, not last

## Human-in-the-loop
- Generate a video, image, music, game

## Property-based tests
- csd <=> decimal
  - to_csd(to_decimal(str)) == str
- Max-Cut:
  Check if the final solution is a bipartite graph.
- Polygon convex hull:
  - hull.area >= original.area
- Convex decomposition:
  - sum of area of pieces == original.area

## Human-in-the-loop
Look at the diagrams
Waveform validation
Cannot do everyday

Coverage
No need to 100% coverage

## Performance test

## Formal verification
