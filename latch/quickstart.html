## Introduction

---

### Latch vs. Flip-Flop

.pull-left[

Latch:

- Level sensitive
- Timing analysis is difficult
- Lack of STA tools
- For low-power, high-speed design

]
.pull-right[

Flip-Flop:

- Edge triggered
- Timing analysis is "easy"
- STA tools are available.
- Very common in any synchronous design.

]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)>

### Timing constraints

- Clock arrival time is splitted into the earilest and the latest one,
  denoted by $a_\text{f}$ and $A_\text{f}$ respectively.

    - $A_\text{f} \geq a_\text{f}$

- Clock departure time $D_{f}$ and $d_{f}$ are defined similarly.

- Besides the setup- and hold-time constraints, there are propagation constraints:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
    D_i & = \max ( A_i,  \phi_i + D_i ) \\
    d_i & = \max ( a_i,  \phi_i + d_i ) \\
    A_i & = \max_j [D_j + C^{j,i} + T_\text{skew}(j,i)] \\
    a_i & = \min_j [d_j + c^{j,i} + T_\text{skew}(j,i)]
  \end{array}$$

  (Note: recurrence relation)

### Max-Plus Algebra

A similar synchronous problem has been studied in
for example, railway systems using $(\max,+)$-algebra.

.pull-left[

Linear Algebra ($+$, $\times$, $0$, $1$):

- $a + b = b + a$
- $a + 0 = a$
- $1 \cdot a = a$
- $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$
]
.pull-right[

Max-Plus Algebra ($\max$, $+$, $-\infty$, $0$):

- $\max(a, b) = \max(b, a)$
- $\max(a, -\infty) = a$
- $0 + a = a$
- $\max(a, b) + c = \max(a + c, b + c)$
]

Unlike linear algebra, $\max$ operation does not have an inverse (semi-ring).

### Eigen-problem in $(\max,+)$ Algebra

- The recurrence relation can be expressed in terms of Max-plus algebra:

  $$ x = A \otimes x$$

  which is an eigen-problem.

## Algorithms to solve the problem

- An obvious way to solve the problem is to use the Power method:
   - iterate the recurrence $x(k) = A \otimes x(k-1)$ until $x(k) = x(k-1)$.
   - Power method is slow.

- **Surprisingly, the problem is equivalent to the maximum mean cycle problem,
  which can be solved efficiently using Howard's method.**

## Timing Analysis

- Current approach 1: kind of using the Power method to solve
  the eigenvalue problem, then check the setup- and hold-time violation.
  - The Power method is slow.
  - The Power method cannot incorporate other design variables.

- Current approach 2: Treat the $\max$ operation as a non-linear function,
  then approximate the scheduling problem as a mixed linear integer programming (MILP).
  - MILP is very slow.
  - MILP can incorporate any design variables.

- Approach 3: Howard's method
  - Howard's method is very fast.
  - The original method can only support a single parameter.

## Timing optimization

- In latch-based design, it was shown that the 50% duty cycle may not be the best choice.
- Thus, both pulse width ($W$) and $T_\text{CP}$ are design parameters.
- The ellipsoid method can be used in this situation.
