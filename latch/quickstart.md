## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction



### Latch vs. Flip-Flop

.pull-left[

Latch:

- Level sensitive
- Timing analysis is difficult
- Lack of STA tools
- For low-power, high-speed design

]
.pull-right[

Flip-Flop:

- Edge triggered
- Timing analysis is "easy"
- STA tools are available.
- Very common in any synchronous design.

### Timing constraints

- The clock arrival time is split into the earliest
  and the latest one, denoted by $a_\text{f}$ and $A_\text{f}$, respectively.

    - $A_\text{f} \geq a_\text{f}$

- The clock departure time $D_{f}$ and $d_{f}$ are defined similarly.

- In addition to the setup- and hold-time constraints, there are propagation constraints:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
    D_i & = \max ( A_i,  \phi_i + D_i ) \\
    d_i & = \max ( a_i,  \phi_i + d_i ) \\
    A_i & = \max_j [D_j + C^{j,i} + T_\text{skew}(j,i)] \\
    a_i & = \min_j [d_j + c^{j,i} + T_\text{skew}(j,i)]
  \end{array}$$

  (Note: recurrence relation)

### Max-Plus Algebra

A similar synchronous scheduling problem has been studied in
for example, a rail system using the $(\max,+)$-algebra.

Linear Algebra ($+$, $\times$, $0$, $1$):

- $a + b = b + a$
- $a + 0 = a$
- $1 \cdot a = a$
- $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$
]
.pull-right[

Max-Plus ($\max$, $+$, $-\infty$, $0$):

- $\max(a, b) = \max(b, a)$
- $\max(a, -\infty) = a$
- $0 + a = a$
- $\max(a, b) + c = \max(a + c, b + c)$
]

Unlike linear algebra, the $\max$ operation has no inverse (semi-ring).

### Eigenvalue problem in $(\max,+)$ Algebra

- The recurrence relation can be expressed in terms of the Max-plus algebra:

  $$ x = A \otimes x$$

  which is an eigen-problem.

## Algorithms to solve the problem

- An obvious way to solve the problem is to use the Power method:
   - iterate recursively $x(k) = A \otimes x(k-1)$ until $x(k) = x(k-1)$.
   - The Power method is slow.

- **Surprisingly, the problem is equivalent to the maximum mean cycle problem, which can be solved efficiently by Howard's method.**



## Timing Analysis

- Current approach 1: sort of like using the Power method to solve
  the eigenvalue problem, then check the setup- and hold-time violation.
  - Power method is slow.
  - Power method cannot incorporate other design variables.

- Current approach 2: Treat the $\max$ operation as a non-linear function, then approximate the scheduling problem as mixed linear integer programming (MILP).
  - MILP is very slow.
  - MILP can incorporate any design variables.

- Approach 3: Howard's method
  - Howard's method is very fast.
  - The original method can only support one parameter.



## Timing Optimization

- In a latch-based design, it was shown that the 50% duty cycle may not be optimal.
- Thus, both pulse width ($W$) and $T_\text{CP}$ are design parameters.
- In this situation, the ellipsoid method can be used.
