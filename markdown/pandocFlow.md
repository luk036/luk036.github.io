## What is Markdown?

-  Markdown is a markup language created by John Gruber that allows users to write plain text documents with easy-to-understand formatting, which can be easily converted into valid XHTML (or HTML) documents.

-  Markdown absorbs many of the plain text markup features already present in emails, and because of its simplicity, ease of use, and support for images, charts, and mathematical equations, many websites and applications have adopted Markdown to create help documents or for posting messages in forums.

## Why Markdown?

-   Lightweight
-   Supports images, charts, math equations
-   Used by many websites and applications for help docs and forums
-   Easy to embed in webpages
-   Useful for version control
-   Large community and ecosystem
-   Convertible to many other formats via `pandoc`

## Why not Markdown?

*   Complex Design - Markdown is great for simple text formatting and basic HTML, but if you need to create complex designs or layouts, it may fall short. In these cases, you may want to consider using a more powerful markup language like HTML or LaTeX, or a desktop publishing software like InDesign or QuarkXPress.

*   Formatted Text Editing - Markdown is great for writing plain text documents, but if you need to edit formatted text or create rich text documents with multiple fonts, colors, and styles, you may want to use a word processing application like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
