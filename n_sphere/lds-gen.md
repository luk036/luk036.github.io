# Low-Discrepancy Sequences & Spherical Point Generation in Python 🐍

### ✨ Introduction: What are Low-Discrepancy Sequences? 🤔

- **Low-Discrepancy Sequences (LDS)** are not random numbers, but rather sequences designed to be **well-distributed** 📊.
- They aim to fill a space more uniformly than pseudo-random number generators 🎲.
- This uniformity is useful in various applications:
  - **Sampling** 🔍
  - **Optimization** ⚙️
  - **Numerical integration** ∫
  - Particularly useful in **Monte Carlo simulations** 🎰

---

### 🧩 The `lds-gen` Package 📦

- The `lds-gen` package is a Python tool specifically for generating **low-discrepancy sequences**.
- It provides classes for different types of LDS 🏗️.
- The main types implemented are:
  - **Van der Corput sequence** (1D) 1️⃣
  - **Halton sequence** (nD) 🧮
  - Other generators like **Circle** ⭕, **Sphere** 🌐, **3-Sphere** 🔮, and **n-dimensional Halton** are also available.

---

### `lds-gen`: Van der Corput Sequence 🔢

- The **Van der Corput sequence** is a 1-dimensional LDS 📏.
- It's based on reversing the digits of the natural number sequence in a given base 🔄.
  - _Example:_ In base 2, 1 is 1 (binary 1), reverse is 1. 2 is 10, reverse is 01 (decimal 0.5). 3 is 11, reverse is 11 (decimal 0.75). 4 is 100, reverse is 001 (decimal 0.125).
- The package provides the **`VdCorput` class** and the core **`vdc_i` function** ⚙️.
- `vdc_i` takes a number `k` and a `base` (default 2) and converts `k` from base 10 to a decimal number using the specified base 🔢.
- The `VdCorput` class wraps `vdc_i` and keeps track of the current count 🧮.

---

### `lds-gen`: Halton Sequence 🌐

- The **Halton sequence** extends the Van der Corput idea to multiple dimensions 🚀.
- It generates **nD points** by combining `n` Van der Corput sequences, each using a **different base** 🏗️.
  - Commonly generates **2D points** using two different bases 2️⃣.
- The source mentions an **n-dimensional Halton generator** specifically.

---

### `lds-gen`: Core Functionality ⚙️

- Generators typically take **base numbers** or sequences of bases as input 📥.
- They produce **floating-point numbers** or lists of floating-point numbers 📊.
- **`pop()` method:** Used to generate the **next point** in the sequence ⏭️.
  - It increments an internal counter and calculates the next value ➕.
  - For multi-dimensional sequences (like Halton), `pop()` returns a list of floats 📋.
- **`reseed()` method:** Allows **resetting the state** of the sequence generator to a specific starting point, determined by a `seed` parameter. Useful for reproducibility 🔄.

---

### `lds-gen`: Example (Van der Corput) 💡

```python
>>> vgen = VdCorput(base=2) # Initialize base 2 generator
>>> vgen.reseed(0) # Reset to start from k=0
>>> for _ in range(10):
...     print(vgen.pop())
0.5
0.25
0.75
0.125
0.625
0.375
0.875
0.0625
0.5625
0.3125
```

### 🌍 The `sphere_n` Package 📦

- The `sphere_n` package is designed to generate points on the **surface of spheres** in different dimensions 🎯.
- It's useful for mathematicians 🧮, scientists 🔬, and computer graphics programmers 🎮.
- The goal is to create **well-distributed** points on the spherical surface ⚖️.
- Uses LDS generators (like Van der Corput) and applies mathematical transformations ➗.

---

### `sphere_n`: Modules & Methods 🧰

- **`sphere_n.cylind_n` module:** Generates points using **cylindrical mapping** 🗺️.
  - Combines a Van der Corput generator with cosine/sine values and the Pythagorean identity 📐.
- **`sphere_n.sphere_n` module:** Generates points on spheres using spherical mapping 🌐.
  - Includes generators for 2D (Circle) ⭕, 3D, and higher dimensions.
  - Uses a combination of Van der Corput sequences and trigonometric functions 📈.
- Both modules/generators provide:
  - **`pop()` method:** Returns the **next point** on the sphere as a list of floats ⏭️.
  - **`reseed()` method:** **Resets the generator** to a specific seed 🔄.

---

### `sphere_n`: Example (3-Sphere) 💡

```python
>>> sgen = Sphere3(base=) # Initialize 3-Sphere generator with bases
>>> sgen.reseed(0) # Reset with seed 0
>>> print(sgen.pop())
[0.4809684718998214, 0.6031153874276115, -0.5785681518302232, 0.2649326520763179, 6.1232...]
```

_Example output from source. Note: Output is a list of coordinates on the 3-sphere._

---

### `sphere_n`: Performance ⚡

- The package uses a **caching mechanism** (`@cache decorator`) to improve performance 🚀.
- This avoids repeating expensive calculations for functions that are called multiple times with the same arguments 🔄.

---

### 🎯 Conclusion 🏁

- The `lds-gen` and `sphere_n` packages provide powerful tools for generating **well-distributed points** 🎯.
- `lds-gen` focuses on generating **low-discrepancy sequences** in various dimensions 📊.
- `sphere_n` specializes in generating points **uniformly on the surface of spheres** 🌐.
- These tools are valuable for improving the efficiency and accuracy of numerical methods in fields like simulations and analysis 🔍.
