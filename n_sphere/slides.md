## Abstract 📝

This note presents a discussion of the generation of low discrepancy sampling methods for n-dimensional spheres. Low discrepancy sequences are important and have been used in a variety of applications, including numerical integration, optimization, and simulation. This note addresses the desirable properties of samples over an n-sphere, including uniformity, determinism, and incrementality. Subsequently, the proposed method for generating low discrepancy sequences over higher dimensional sphere is presented, which is based on the van der Corput sequence. We provide a comprehensive account of the algorithm and its implementation. Furthermore, the note presents the results of numerical experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, including a comparison with randomly generated sequences and other proposed methods such as the Hopf coordinate method and the cylindrical coordinate method.

## Introduction and Motivation 🎯

---

## Motivation 💡

- Low discrepancy sequences (LDS) play a pivotal role in numerous fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

- While low discrepancy sampling methods have been extensively studied in lower dimensions, there is an increasing need for efficient sampling techniques in higher dimensions.

---

## Importance of Low Discrepancy Sequences (LDS) 🔑

- Uniform distribution 👔

  LDS's provide a more uniform distribution of points than random sampling, reducing computational errors and improving the accuracy for all types of applications.

- Determinism 📌

  They provide a deterministic sequence of points, which is essential for reproducibility and consistency in simulations and experiments.

- Incrementality 📶

  More importantly, they allow for the efficient addition of new points to an existing sequence, which is useful in applications where the number of points required to solve a problem is not known in advance.

---

## Potential Applications 🚀

- Robotic Motion Planning [@yershova2010generating] 🤖

  In $S^3$ and SO(3), LDS provide uniformly distributed point sets, which are suitable for robot path planning.

- Wireless Communication Coding [@utkovski2006construction] 🛜

  Spherical coding in MIMO systems employs the dots generated by LDS as codewords, which are used to construct a codebook for the MIMO system.

- Filter Bank Design [@mandic2011filter] ♒︎

  Filter bank design for multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) [@rehman2010multivariate] is based on the van der Corput sequence.

- Statistical and machine learning (training normalized parameters) 🧠

# Theoretical Background and Related Work 📚

## van der Corput sequence 🔢

- The van der Corput sequence is a low-discrepancy sequence used to generate uniformly distributed points in the interval [0,1].

- The sequence is constructed by reversing the base-b (usually prime) representation of the sequence of natural numbers.

  ![image](./vdcorput.svg)

- The sequence is the basis for constructing higher dimensional low-discrepancy sequences.

- The van der Corput sequence is named after the Dutch mathematician Johannes van der Corput, who first introduced it in 1935.

## Python Implementation 🐍

```python
def vdc(k: int, base: int = 2) -> float:
    res = 0.0
    denom = 1.0
    while k != 0:
        denom *= base
        k, remainder = divmod(k, base)
        res += remainder / denom
    return res
```

---

## VdCorput class 🏗️

```python
class VdCorput:
    def __init__(self, base: int = 2) -> None:
        self.count: int = 0
        self.base: int = base
        self.rev_lst: List[float] = []
        reverse: float = 1.0
        for i in range(64):
            reverse /= base
            self.rev_lst.append(reverse)

    def pop(self) -> float:
        self.count += 1  # ignore 0
        k = self.count
        res = 0.0
        i = 0
        while k != 0:
            k, remainder = divmod(k, self.base)
            res += remainder * self.rev_lst[i]
            i += 1
        return res

    def reseed(self, seed: int) -> None:
        self.count = seed
```

## Unit Circle $S^1$ ⭕

- Can be generated by mapping the van der Corput sequence to $[0, 2\pi]$:
  - $\varphi = 2\pi\cdot\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_1)$ % map to $[0,2\pi]$
  - $[x, y] = [\cos\varphi, \sin\varphi]$

## Python Implementation 🐍

```python
from math import cos, pi, sin, sqrt
TWO_PI = 2.0 * pi

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, base: int) -> None:
        self.vdc = VdCorput(base)

    def pop(self) -> List[float]:
        theta = self.vdc.pop() * TWO_PI  # map to [0, 2π]
        return [cos(theta), sin(theta)]
```

## Halton sequence on $[0,1]^2$

- The Halton sequence is constructed by combining two van der Corput sequences, which are generated using different prime numbers as the base.

  $$[x, y] = [\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_1), \mathrm{vdc}(k,b_2)]$$

.pull-left[

- The resulting sequence is a low-discrepancy sequence that is uniformly distributed over the unit square.

## Halton sequence on $[0,1]^n$ 🧊

- The concept of the Halton sequence can be extended to higher dimensions through the combination of multiple one-dimensional sequences, each generated using a distinct prime number as the base.

  $$[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n] = [\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_1), \mathrm{vdc}(k,b_2), \dots, \mathrm{vdc}(k,b_n)]$$

.pull-left[

- This approach permits the generation of points that are distributed uniformly in a multidimensional space. There are a multitude of potential applications for quasi-Monte Carlo methods (QMC).

## How to generate LDS on $S^3$ and SO(3) 🔧

Similar to the LDS generation on $S^2$, we perform the mapping:

- $\varphi = 2\pi\cdot\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_1)$ % map to $[0,2\pi]$
- $\psi = 2\pi\cdot\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_2)$ % map to $[0,2\pi]$ for SO(3), or
- $\psi = 4\pi\cdot\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_2)$ % map to $[0,4\pi]$ for $S^3$
- $z = 2\cdot\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_3) - 1$ % map to $[-1,1]$
- $\theta = \cos^{-1}z$

  - $x_2 = \sin\theta_3 \sin\theta_2 \cos\theta_1$
  - $x_3 = \sin\theta_3 \sin\theta_2 \sin\theta_1$

- Spherical surface element:

## Unit N-Sphere $S^n$ 🪐

- Polar coordinates:

  - $x_1 = \sin\theta_n \cos\theta_{n-1}$
  - $x_2 = \sin\theta_n \sin\theta_{n-1} \cos\theta_{n-2}$

## How to Generate the Point Set 🔄

- $p_0 = [\cos\theta_0, \sin\theta_0]$ where $\theta_0 = 2\pi\cdot\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_0)$
- Let $f_j(\theta)$ = $\int\sin^j\theta \mathrm{d}\theta$, where $\theta\in (0,\pi)$.
  - Note 1: The function can be defined recursively as:
    $$f_j(\theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      \theta          & \text{if } j = 0 , \\
      -\cos\theta     & \text{if } j = 1 , \\
      (1/n)( -\cos\theta \sin^{j-1}\theta + (n-1) f_{j - 2}(\theta)) & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
    $$
  - Note 2: $f_j(\theta)$ is a monotonic increasing function in
    $(0,\pi)$
- Map $\mathrm{vdc}(k,b_j)$ to $f_j(\theta)$: $t_j = f_j(0) + (f_j(\pi) - f_j(0)) \mathrm{vdc}(k,b_j)$
- Let $\theta_j = f_j^{-1}(t_j)$
- $p_n = [\sin\theta_n \cdot p_{n-1}, \cos\theta_n]$

## Random sequences 🎲

- To generate random points on $S^n$, the spherical symmetry of the multidimensional Gaussian density function can be exploited.

- This results in a normalized vector ($x_i/\|x_i\|$) that is uniformly distributed over the hypersphere $S^n$. (Fishman, G. F. (1996))
