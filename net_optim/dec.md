*   **What is DEC?** 🤔💡
*   A framework for computational modeling. ⚙️
*   Based on differential forms and simplicial meshes. 📊
*   Extends continuous exterior calculus to a discrete setting. 🔄
*   Goal: Preserve geometric and physical structure in numerical simulations. 🎯

## 🌌 Exterior Calculus Basics 🔍

```mermaid
pie
    title Differential Forms
    "0-form (Scalar)" : 30
    "1-form (Line Integral)" : 30
    "2-form (Surface Integral)" : 20
    "3-form (Volume Integral)" : 20
```

*   Exterior calculus deals with **differential forms (k-forms)**. 📜
*   They are related to quantities integrated over geometric objects. 📏
    *   **0-form:** Like a scalar function (e.g., elevation at a point). 📍
    *   **1-form:** Like a quantity integrated along a curve (e.g., elevation *gain* along a path). 🛤️
*   Closely related to vector calculus operations. 🔄
    *   Exterior derivative of a 1-form looks like the curl of a vector field. 🌪️

## 🤖 DEC on Simplicial Complexes 🏗️

```mermaid

    V[Vertex - 0-form] -->|d0| E[Edge - 1-form]
    E -->|d1| F[Face - 2-form]
    F -->|d2| V3[Volume - 3-form]

    style E fill:#6f9,stroke:#333
    style F fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style V3 fill:#9cf,stroke:#333
```

*   DEC operates on **simplicial complexes** (meshes) and their associated **dual meshes**. 🔲
*   A **discrete k-form** represents the integral of a continuous k-form over a k-dimensional mesh object (primal or dual). 📊
    *   Discrete **0-form**: Scalar value at a **vertex**. ⚫
    *   Discrete **1-form**: Value associated with an **edge** (integral along an edge). ➖
    *   Discrete **2-form** (in 2D): Value associated with a **triangle**. 🔺
    *   Discrete variables require specifying an **orientation** for each mesh element, just like elevation gain needs direction (+151m vs -151m). 🔄
*   Discrete differential forms are stored with both a number and the specified orientation. 🔢

## ✨ The Core Trio: d, ★, ∧

```mermaid

    A[d: Exterior Derivative] --> B[Generalizes differentiation]
    C[★: Hodge Star] --> D[Maps primal to dual]
    E[∧: Wedge Product] --> F[Multiplies forms]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#6f9,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#f96,stroke:#333
```

*   **Exterior Derivative (d)**: Generalizes differentiation. Maps k-forms to (k+1)-forms. 🔄
    *   `d0` maps values on vertices (0-forms) to values on edges (1-forms). ↗️
    *   Requires taking orientation into account. 🔄
    *   In continuous calculus, `d` on 1-forms looks like curl. 🌪️
    *   A defining property: `d` applied twice is zero (`dp+1dp = 0`). ❌
*   **Hodge Star Operator (★)**: 💫🌟 Relates k-forms to (N-k)-forms in N dimensions. Incorporates metric information. Often transfers forms between primal and dual complexes. A Delaunay Hodge star exists. ⭐
*   **Wedge Product (∧)**: 🌱✖️ Multiplies forms. The discrete definition involves integration. For instance, a 1-form wedge a 0-form results in a 1-form. ➗

*   Used for discretizing the **incompressible Navier–Stokes equations** over surface simplicial meshes. 📜
*   Uses a **primitive variable DEC formulation** with velocity as a one-form (often dual) and pressure as a zero-form (often dual). This choice means velocity integrals along dual edges correspond to mass flux across primal edges. ⚡

    style Convergence fill:#f96,stroke:#333
```

*   Discrete operators (like the discrete Laplacian or exterior derivative matrices) are often implemented as **sparse matrices**. 🔢
*   Implementation examples and libraries exist:
    *   A supplementary C++ framework is available. 📦
    *   **PyDEC** is a Python library for DEC on simplicial and cubical complexes of any dimension, implementing discrete exterior derivative (as coboundary), Delaunay Hodge star, and Whitney forms. 🐍
*   **Convergence**:
    *   Rigorous convergence analysis for the scalar Poisson problem on arbitrary domains has been established. ✅
    *   Numerical tests show convergence. For Taylor-Green vortices, the velocity *flux* error shows second-order convergence on structured meshes and better than first-order on unstructured meshes. Interpolated velocity error is slightly better than first-order. 📈
    *   The kinetic energy relative error converges in a second-order fashion with mesh size for the double periodic shear layer case. ⚡
