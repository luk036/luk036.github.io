Introduction
------------

---

### Why and why not

.pull-left[

-   👍 Algorithms available for common network problems (Python:
    networkx, C++: Boost Graph Library (BGL)):
    -   Explore network locality.
    -   Explore associativity (things can be summed up in any order)
-   👍 Can solve integer problems optimally (e.g. matching/assignment
    problems):

-   👍 Bonus: give you also an insight of the most critical portion of
    the network (critical cut/cycle):

] .pull-right[

-   👎 Theory is difficult to understand.

-   👎 Algorithms are difficult to understand (some algorithms do not
    allow user to have an input flow in reverse direction, but
    internally create reverse edges for backward flows).

-   👎 Too many algorithms available. You have to choose them wisely.

### Flow and Potential

.pull-left[

-   Cut
-   Current
-   Flow ${\color{green}x}$
-   Sum of ${\color{green}x}_{ij}$ around a node = 0

![flow](media/flow.svg)

] .pull-right[

-   Cycle/Path
-   Voltage
-   Tension ${\color{blue}y}$
-   Sum of ${\color{blue}y}_{ij}$ around a cycle = 0

![potential](media/potential.svg)

]

---

### If you know nothing more...

-   For min-cost linear flow problem, the best guess is to use "network
    simplex algorithm".

-   For min-cost linear potential problem: formulate it to the dual flow
    problem.

-   For Parametric potential problem (single parameter), the best guess
    is to use "Howard's algorithm".

-   All these algorithms are based on the idea of finding "negative
    cycle".

-   You may apply the same principle to the nonlinear problem.

---

### For dual problems...

-   Dual problems can be solved by applying the same principle.

-   Finding a negative cycle is replaced by finding a negative "cut",
    which is be more difficult...

-   ...unless your network is a planar graph.

---

### Guideline for General Users

-   Look for specialized algorithms for specialized problems. For
    example, for bipartite maximum cardinality matching, use
    Hopcroft--Karp matching algorithm.

-   Avoid creating edges with infinity costs. Delete them or reformuate
    your problem properly.

---

### Guideline for Algorithm Developers

-   Make "negative cycles" orthogonal as possible with each other.

-   Reuse the previous solution as a new starting point in finding
    negative cycles.

💡 Essential Concepts
--------------------

---

### Basic Elements of Network

#### Definition (Network)

A *network* is a collection of finite-dimensional vector spaces of
*nodes* and *edges*/*arcs*:

-   $V = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_N \}$, where $|V| = N$
-   $E = \{e_1, e_2, e_3, \cdots, e_M \}$ where $|E| = M$

which satisfies 2 requirements:

1.  The boundary of each edge is comprised of the union of nodes
2.  The intersection of any edges is either empty or a boundary node of
    both edges.

---

### Network

-   According to this definition, a network can contain self-loops and
    multi-edges.

-   A *graph* structure encodes the neigborhood information of nodes and
    edges.

-   Note that Python's NetworkX needs special handle for multi-edges.

-   The most efficient graph representation is adjacency list.

-   The concept of graph can be generalized to *complex*: node, edge,
    face...

#### Varieties of Graphs

Bipartite graph, tree, planar graph, st-graph, complete graph.

---

### Orientation

#### Definition (Orientation)

An *orientation* of an edge is an ordering of its boundary node
$(s, t)$, where

-   $s$ is called a source/initial node
-   $t$ is called a target/terminal node

Note: orientation != direction

#### Definition (Coherent)

Two orientations to be the same is called *coherent*

---

### Node-edge Incidence Matrix

#### Definition (Incidence Matrix)

An $N \times M$ matrix $A^\mathsf{T}$ is a node-edge incidence matrix
with entries:

$$A(i,j) =  
  \begin{cases}  
   +1 & \text{if $e_i$ is coherent with the orientation of node $v_j$} \,, \\
   -1 & \text{if $e_i$ is not coherent with the orientation of node $v_j$} \,, \\  
    0 & \text{otherwise } \,.
  \end{cases}$$

#### Remark

Usually we don't form the matrix in algorithms.

#### Example

$$A^\mathsf{T} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\
  -1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}$$

---

### Chain

#### Definition (Chain $\tau$)

An edge/node *chain* $\tau$ is an $M$/$N$-tuple of scalar which assigns
a coefficient to each edge/node, where $M$/$N$ is the number of distinct
edges/nodes in the network.

#### Remark (II)

A chain may be viewed as an (oriented) indictor vector representing a
set of edges/nodes.

#### Example (II)

$[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]$, $[0, 0, 1, -1, 1]$

---

### Discrete Boundary Operator

#### Definition (Boundary operator)

The *boundary* operator $\partial = A^\mathsf{T}$.

#### Definition (Cycle)

A chain is called a *cycle* if it is in the nullspace of the boundary
operator, i.e. $A^\mathsf{T} \tau = 0$

#### Definition (Boundary)

A chain $\beta$ is called a *boundary* of $\tau$ if it is in the range
of the boundary operator

---

### Co-boundary Operator $\mathrm{d}$

#### Definition (Co-boundary operator)

The *co-boundary* (or *differential*) operator
$\mathrm{d} = \partial^* = (A^\mathsf{T})^* = A$

#### Note

Nullspace of $A$ is \#components of a graph

---

### Discrete Stokes' Theorem

-   Let $$\tau_i = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if $e_i \in S$} , \\
        0 & \text{otherwise} .
      \end{cases}$$
-   Conventional (integration):
    $${\color{purple}\int}_{\color{red}S} {\color{green}\mathrm d} \tilde{\omega} = {\color{purple}\oint}_{\color{blue}\partial \color{red}S} \tilde{\omega}$$
-   Discrete (pairing):
    $${\color{purple}{[} \color{red}\tau}, {\color{green}A}\omega{\color{purple}]} = {\color{purple}[ \color{blue}A^\mathsf{T} \color{red} \tau}, \omega{\color{purple}]}$$

---

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

-   Conventional (integration): $\int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) - F(a)$

-   Discrete (pairing): $[\tau_1, A c^0] = [A^\mathsf{T}\tau_1, c^0]$

![stokes](media/stokes.svg)

---

### Divergence and Flow

#### Definition (Divergence)

$\text{div}\, {\color{green}x} = A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x}$

#### Definition (Flow)

${\color{green}x}$ is called a *flow* if
$\sum \text{div}\, {\color{green}x} = 0$, where all negative entries of
(div ${\color{green}x}$) are called *sources* and positive entries are
called *sinks*.

#### Definition (Circulation)

A network is called a *circulation* if there is no source or sink. In
other words, $\text{div}\, {\color{green}x} = 0$

---

### Tension and Potential

#### Definition (Tension)

A tension (in co-domain) ${\color{blue}y}$ is a *differential* of a
*potential* ${\color{red}u}$, i.e. ${\color{blue}y}= A {\color{red}u}$.

#### Theorem (Tellgen's)

Flow and tension are bi-orthogonal (isomorphic).

#### Proof

$0 = [A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x}, {\color{red}u}] = (A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x})^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} = {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} (A {\color{red}u}) = {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y}$

---

### Path

A path indicator vector $\tau$ of $P$ that $$\tau_i =
    \begin{cases}
       1 & \text{if $e_i \in P$} \,, \\
       0 & \text{otherwise}\,.
    \end{cases}$$

#### Theorem

[total tension ${\color{blue}y}$ on $P$] = [total potential on the
boundary of $P$].

#### Proof

${\color{blue}y}^\mathsf{T} \tau = (A {\color{red}u})^\mathsf{T} \tau = {\color{red}u}^\mathsf{T}(A^\mathsf{T} \tau) = {\color{red}u}^\mathsf{T}(\partial P)$.

---

### Cut

Two node sets $S$ and $S'$ (the complement of $S$, i.e. $V - S$). A cut
$Q$ is an edge set, denoted by $[S, S']^-$. A cut indicator vector $q$
(oriented) of $Q$ is defined as $A c$ where $$c_i =
                \begin{cases}
                  1 & \text{if } v_i \in S \,, \\
                  0 & \text{otherwise}\,.
                \end{cases}
$$

#### Theorem (Stokes' theorem!)

[total divergence of ${\color{green}x}$ on $S$] = [total
${\color{green}x}$ across $Q$].

#### Proof

$(\text{div}\,{\color{green}x})^\mathsf{T} c = (A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x})^\mathsf{T} c = {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} (A c) = {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} q$.

Feasibility Problems
--------------------

---

### Feasible Flow/Potential Problem

.pull-left[

Feasible Flow Problem

-   Find a flow ${\color{green}x}$ such that: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      c^- \leq {\color{green}x} \leq c^+, \\
      A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} = b, b(V) = 0.
      \end{array}$$

-   Can be solved using:

    -   Painted network algorithm

    -   If no feasible solution, return a "negative cut".

] .pull-right[

Feasible Potential Problem:

-   Find a potential ${\color{red}u}$ such that: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      d^- \leq {\color{blue}y} \leq d^+  \\
      A \cdot {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}.
      \end{array}$$

-   Can be solved using:

    -   Bellman-Ford algorithm

    -   If no feasible solution, return a "negative cycle".

]

---

### Examples

Genome-scale reaction network (primal)

-   $A$: Stoichiometric matrix $S$

-   ${\color{green}x}$: reactions between metabolites/proteins

-   $c^- \leq {\color{green}x} \leq c^+$: constraints on reaction rates

Timing constraints (co-domain)

-   $A^\mathsf{T}$: incidence matrix of timing constraint graph

-   ${\color{red}u}$: arrival time of clock

-   ${\color{blue}y}$: clock skew

-   $d^- \leq {\color{blue}y} \leq d^+$: setup- and hold-time
    constraints

---

### Feasibility Flow Problem

#### Theorem (feasibility flow)

The problem has a feasible solution if and only if $b(S) \leq c^+(Q)$
for all cuts $Q = [S,S']$ where $c^+(Q)$ = upper capacity [1, p. 56].

#### Proof (if-part)

Let $q = A \cdot k$ be a cut vector (oriented) of $Q$. Then

-   $c^- \leq {\color{green}x} \leq c^+$

--

-   $q^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} \leq c^+(Q)$

--

-   $(A \cdot k)^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} \leq c^+(Q)$

--

-   $k^\mathsf{T} A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} \leq c^+(Q)$

--

-   $k^\mathsf{T} b \leq c^+(Q)$

--

-   $b(S) \leq c^+(Q)$

---

### Feasibility Potential Problem

#### Theorem (feasibility potential)

The problem has a feasible solution if and only if $d^+(P) \geq 0$ for
all cycles $P$ where $d^+(P)$ = upper span [1, p. ??].

#### Proof (if-part)

Let $\tau$ be a path indicator vector (oriented) of $P$. Then

-   $d^- \leq {\color{blue}y} \leq d^+$

--

-   $\tau^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} \leq d^+(P)$

--

-   $\tau^\mathsf{T} (A \cdot {\color{red}u}) \leq d^+(P)$

--

-   $(A^\mathsf{T} \tau)^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} \leq d^+(P)$

--

-   $(\partial P)^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} \leq d^+(P)$

--

-   $0 \leq d^+(P)$

---

### Remarks

-   The only-if part of the proof is constructive. It can be done by
    constructing an algorithm to obtain the feasible solution.

-   $d^+$ could be $\infty$ or zero, etc.

-   $d^-$ could be $-\infty$ or zero, etc.

-   $c^+$ could be $\infty$ or zero, etc.

-   $c^-$ could be $-\infty$ or zero, etc.

> Note: most tools require that $c^-$ must be zero such that the
> solution flow ${\color{green}x}$ is always positive.

---

### Convert to the elementary problem

.pull-left[

-   By splitting every edges into two, the feasibility flow problem can
    reduce to an elementary one:
    -   Find a flow ${\color{green}x}$ such that
        $$\begin{array}{ll}
          c \leq {\color{green}x}, \\
          A_1^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} = b_1, \\
          b_1(V_1) = 0.
        \end{array}$$

        where $A_1$ is the incident matrix of the modified network.

### Convert to the elementary problem

.pull-left[

-   By adding reverse edges for every edges, the feasibility potential
    problem can reduce to an elementary one:

    -   Find a potential ${\color{red}u}$ such that
        $$\begin{array}{ll}
          {\color{blue}y}_2 \leq d, \\
          A_2 {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}_2
        \end{array}$$

        where $A_2$ is the incident matrix of the modified network.

### Basic Bellman-Ford Algorithm

```matlab
function BellmanFord(list vertices, list edges, vertex source)
   // Step 1: initialize graph
   for each vertex i in vertices:
       if i is source then u[i] := 0
       else u[i] := inf
       predecessor[i] := null

   // Step 2: relax edges repeatedly
   for i from 1 to size(vertices)-1:
       for each edge (i, j) with weight d in edges:
           if u[j] > u[i] + d[i,j]:
               u[j] := u[i] + d[i,j]
               predecessor[j] := i

   // Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles
   for each edge (i, j) with weight d in edges:
       if u[j] > u[i] + d[i,j]:
           error "Graph contains a negative-weight cycle"
   return u[], predecessor[]
```

---

.small[

```python
def _neg_cycle_relaxation(G, pred, dist, source, weight):
    G_succ = G.succ if G.is_directed() else G.adj
    inf = float('inf')
    n = len(G)
    count = {}
    q = deque(source)
    in_q = set(source)
    while q:
        u = q.popleft()
        in_q.remove(u)
        if pred[u] not in in_q:
            dist_u = dist[u]
            for v, e in G_succ[u].items():
                dist_v = dist_u + get_weight(e)
*                if dist_v < dist.get(v, inf):
                    if v not in in_q:
                        q.append(v)
                        in_q.add(v)
                        count_v = count.get(v, 0) + 1
                        if count_v == n:
                            return v
                        count[v] = count_v
                    dist[v] = dist_v
                    pred[v] = u
    return None
```

### Example 1 : Clock skew scheduling

-   Goal: intentionally assign each register an arrival time $u_i$ such
    that the setup and hold time constraints are satistied.
-   Note: the clock skew $s_{ij} = {\color{red}u}_i - {\color{red}u}_j$
    is more important than the arrival time ${\color{red}u}$ itself
    because clock is running periodically.
-   At the eariler stage, fixing the timing violation could be done as
    soon as a negative cycle is detected. Complete timing analysis is
    not necessary at this stage.

---

### Example 2 : Delay padding + clock skew scheduling

-   Goal: intentionally "insert" delay $p$ for such that the setup and
    hold time constraints are satistied.
-   Note that a delay can be "inserted" by swapping a fast transistor
    into a slower one.
-   Traditional problem formulation: Find $p$ and ${\color{red}u}$ such
    that

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      {\color{blue}y} \leq d + p, \\
      A {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}, p \geq 0
    \end{array}$$

-   Note 1: Inserting delay to some local paths may not be allowed.
-   Note 2: the problem can be reduced to the standard form by modifing
    the network (timing constraint graph)

---

### Four possible ways to insert delay

.pull-left[

No delay: ![no\_delay](media/no_delay.svg)

$p_s = p_h$: ![same\_delay](media/same_delay.svg)

] .pull-right[

Independent: ![independent](media/independent.svg)

$p_s \geq p_h$: ![setup\_greater](media/setup_greater.svg)

]

---

### Remarks (III)

-   If there exists a negative cycle, it means that timing cannot be
    fixed using simply this technique.

-   Additional constraints, such as $p_s \leq p_{\max}$, can be imposed.

Parametric Problems
-------------------

---

### Parametric Potential Problem (PPP)

-   Consider a parameter potential problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize}   & \beta \\
      \text{subject to} & {\color{blue}y} \leq d(\beta), \\
      & A \cdot {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}
    \end{array}$$ where $d(\beta)$ is a *monotonic decreasing*
    function.

-   If $d(\beta)$ is a linear function $(m - s \beta)$ where $s$ is
    non-negative, the problem reduces to the well-known *minimum
    cost-to-time ratio problem*.

-   If $s$ = constant, it further reduces to the *minimum mean cycle
    problem*.

> **Note:** Parametric flow problem can be defined similarly.

---

### Examples (III)

-   $d(\beta)$ is linear $(m - s \beta)$:

    -   Optimal clock period scheduling problem

    -   Slack maximization problem

    -   Yield-driven clock skew scheduling (Gaussian)

-   $d(\beta)$ is non-linear:

    -   Yield-driven clock skew scheduling (non-Gaussian)

    -   Multi-domain clock skew scheduling

---

### Examples (IV)

-   Lawler's algorithm (binary search based)

-   Howard's algorithm (cycle cancellation)

-   Young's algorithm (path based)

-   Burns' algorithm (path based)

    -   for clock period optimization problem (all elements of $s$ are
        either 0 or 1)

-   Several hybrid methods are also proposed

---

### Remarks (IV)

-   Need to solve feasibility problems many time

-   Data structures, such as Fibonacci heap or spanning tree/forest, may
    be used for efficiency

-   For multi-parameter problems, the *ellipsoid method* can be used.

-   Example 1: yield-driven clock skew scheduling (c.f. lecture 5)

---

### Example 2: yield-driven delay padding

-   The problem can be reduced to the standard form by modifying the
    underlying constraint graph.

Min-cost Flow/Potenial Problem
------------------------------

---

### Elementary Optimal Problems

-   Elementary Flow Problem:
    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} + p \\
      \text{s. t.} & c \leq {\color{green}x}, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

-   Elementary Potential Problem:
    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{max}   & b^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} - (c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} + q) \\
      \text{s. t.} & {\color{blue}y} \leq d, \\
      & A {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}
    \end{array}$$

---

### Elementary Optimal Problems (Cont'd)

-   The problems are dual to each other if
    $p + q = -c^\mathsf{T} d, ({\color{green}x} - c)^\mathsf{T}(d - {\color{blue}y}) = 0, c \leq {\color{green}x}, {\color{blue}y} \leq d$

-   Since
    $b^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u}$ = 
    $(A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x})^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} = {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} A {\color{red}u} = {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y},$
    $[\min]-[\max] = (d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} + p) - (b^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} - [c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} + q])$
    =
    $d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} + c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} - {\color{green}x}^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} + p + q = ({\color{green}x} - c)^\mathsf{T} (d - {\color{blue}y}) \geq 0$

-   $[\min] - [\max]$ when equality holds.

---

### Remark (V)

-   We can formulate a linear problem either in its primal form or in
    its dual form, depending on which solving method is more
    appropriate:

    -   Improve feasible solutions incrementally

    -   Design variables are in integral domain:

        -   max-flow problem (i.e.
            $d^\mathsf{T} = [-1, -1, \cdots, -1]^\mathsf{T}$) may be
            better to be solved by a dual method.

---

### Linear Optimal Problems

-   Optimal Flow Problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} + p \\
      \text{s. t.} & c^- \leq {\color{green}x} \leq c^+, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

-   Optimal Potential Problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{max}   & b^\mathsf{T} {\color{red}u} - (c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} + q) \\
      \text{s. t.} & d^- \leq {\color{blue}y} \leq d^+, \\
      & A {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}
    \end{array}$$

---

### Linear Optimal Problems (II)

By modifying the network:

-   This problem can be reduced to the elementary case [pp.275-276]

-   Piecewise linear convex cost can be reduced to this linear problem
    [p.239,p.260]

The problem has been studied extensively with a lot of applications.

### Remark (VI)

-   We can transform the cost function to be non-negative by reversing
    the orientation of the negative cost edges.

-   Then reduce the problem to the elementary case (or should we???)

---

### Algorithms for Optimal Flow Problems

-   Successive shortest path algorithm

-   Cycle cancellation method

    -   iteratively insert additional minimal flows according to a
        negative cycle of the residual network, until no negative cycle
        is found.

-   Scaling method

---

### For Special Cases

-   Max flow problem ($d = -[1, \cdots, 1]$)

    -   Ford-Fulkerson algorithm: iteratively insert additional minimal
        flows according to an augmented path of the residual network,
        until no augmented path of the residual network, until no
        augmented path is found.

    -   Preflow Push-Relabel algorithm (dual method???)

-   Matching problems ($[c^-, c^+] = [0, 1]$)

    -   Edmond's blossom algorithm

### Min-Cost Flow Problem (MCFP)

-   Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} \\
      \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq {\color{green}x} \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} = b, \; b(V)=0
    \end{array}$$

-   Algorithm idea: descent method: given a feasible
    ${\color{green}x}_0$, find a better solution
    ${\color{green}x}_1 = {\color{green}x}_0 + \alpha p$, where $\alpha$
    is positive.

---

### General Descent Method

-   **Input**: $f(x)$, initial $x$
-   **Output**: optimal opt $x^*$
-   **while** not converged,
    1.  Choose descent direction $p$;
    2.  Choose the step size $\alpha$;
    3.  $x := x + \alpha p$;

---

### Some Common Descent Directions

-   Gradient descent: $p = -\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T}$
-   Steepest descent:
    -   $\triangle x_{nsd}$ =
        argmin$\{\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T} v \mid \|v\|=1 \}$
    -   $\triangle x_{sd}$ = $\|\nabla f(x)\| \triangle x_{nsd}$
        (un-normalized)
-   Newton's method: $p = -\nabla^2 f(x)^{-1} \nabla f(x)$
-   For convex problems, must satisfy $\nabla f(x)^\mathsf{T} p < 0$.

> **Note:** Here, there is a natural way to choose $p$!

---

### Min-Cost Flow Problem (II)

-   Let ${\color{green}x}_1 = {\color{green}x}_0 + \alpha p$, then we
    have: $$\begin{array}{lll}
      \text{min}   & d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x}_0 + \alpha d^\mathsf{T} p  & \Rightarrow d^\mathsf{T} p < 0 \\
      \text{s. t.} & -{\color{green}x}_0 \leq \alpha p \leq c-{\color{green}x}_0 & \Rightarrow \text{residual graph} \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} p = 0 & \Rightarrow p \text{ is a cycle!}
    \end{array}$$

-   In other words, choose $p$ to be a negative cycle!

    -   Simple negative cycle, or

    -   Minimum mean cycle

---

### Primal Method for MCFP

-   **Input**: $G(V,E), [c^-, c^+], d$
-   **Output**: optimal opt ${\color{green}x}^*$
-   Initialize a feasible ${\color{green}x}$ and certain data structure
-   **while** a negative cycle $p$ found in $G({\color{green}x})$,
    1.  Choose a step size $\alpha$;
    2.  **If** $\alpha$ is unbounded, **return** UNBOUNDED;
    3.  **If** $\alpha = 0$, **break**;
    4.  ${\color{green}x} := {\color{green}x} + \alpha p$;
    5.  Update corresponding data structures
-   **return** OPTIMAL

---

### Remarks (VI)

-   In Step 4, negative cycle can be found using Bellman-Ford algorithm.

-   In the cycle cancelling algorithm, $p$ is:

    -   a simple negative cycle, or

    -   a minimum mean cycle

-   A heap or other data structures are used for finding negative cycles
    efficiently.

-   Usually $\alpha$ is chosen such that one constraint is tight.

---

### Min-Cost Potential Problem (MCPP)

-   Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} \\
      \text{s. t.} & {\color{blue}y} \leq d, \\
      & A {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}
    \end{array}$$ where $c$ is assumed to be non-negative.

-   Algorithm: given an initial feasible $u_0$, find a better solution
    $u_1 = {\color{red}u}_0 + \beta q$, where $\beta$ is positive:
    $$\begin{array}{lll}
      \text{min}   & c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y}_0 + c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y}  & \Rightarrow c^\mathsf{T} {\color{blue}y} < 0 \\
      \text{s. t.} & {\color{blue}y} \leq d - A {\color{red}u}_0 & \Rightarrow \text{residual graph} \\
      & \beta A q = {\color{blue}y}    & \Rightarrow q \; \text{is a ``cut''!}
    \end{array}$$

---

### Method for MCPP

-   **Input**: $G(V,E), c, d$
-   **Output**: optimal opt ${\color{red}u}^*$
-   Initialize a feasible ${\color{red}u}$ and certain data structure
-   **while** a negative cut $q$ found in $G({\color{red}u})$,
    1.  Choose a step size $\beta$;
    2.  **If** $\beta$ is unbounded, **return** UNBOUNDED;
    3.  **If** $\beta = 0$, **break**;
    4.  ${\color{red}u} := {\color{red}u} + \beta q$;
    5.  Update corresponding data structures
-   **return** OPTIMAL

---

### Remarks (VII)

-   Usually $\beta$ is chosen such that one constraint is tight.

-   Min-cost potential problem is a dual of min-cost flow problem, hence
    algorithms can solve both problems.

-   In the network simplex method, $q$ is chosen from a spanning tree
    data structure (only for linear problems)

---

### E.g. Delay Padding

-   Consider the following problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}  & c^\mathsf{T} p, \\
      \text{s.t.} & {\color{blue}y} \leq d + p, \\
      & A {\color{red}u} = {\color{blue}y}, \; p \geq 0
    \end{array}$$ where $p$: delay padding

-   Its dual is: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & d^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x}  \\
      \text{s.t.} & 0 \leq {\color{green}x} \leq c, \\
      & A^\mathsf{T} {\color{green}x} = 0
    \end{array}$$
