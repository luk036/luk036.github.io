Introduction
============

---

Why and why not
---------------

- Algorithms available (Python: networkx, C++: LEDA):
    - Explore network locality.
    - Explore associativity and distributivity.

- Can solve integer problems optimally (e.g. matching/assignment problems):

- Bonus: give you also an insight of the most critical portion of the network (critical cut/cycle):

- Theory is difficult to understand. Algorithms are difficult to understand.

- Too many algorithms available. You have to choose them wisely.

Essential Concepts
==================

---

Basic Elements of Network
-------------------------

#### Definition (Network)

A *network* is a collection of finite-dimensional vector spaces of
*nodes* and *edges*/*arcs*:

- $V = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_N \}$, where $|V| = N$
- $E = \{e_1, e_2, e_3, \cdots, e_M \}$ where $|E| = M$

which satisfies 2 requirements:

1.  The boundary of each edge is comprised of the union of nodes
2.  The intersection of any edges is either empty or a boundary node of
    both edges.

---

Network
-------

- According to this definition, a network can contain self-loops and multi-edges.
- A *graph* structure encodes the neigborhood information of nodes and edges.
- The concept of graph can be generalized to *complex*: node, edge, face...

#### Examples of Grap

Bipartite graph, tree, planar graph, st-graph, complete graph.

---

Orientation
-----------

#### Definition (Orientation):

An *orientation* of an edge is an ordering of its boundary node
$(s, t)$, where

- $s$ is called a source/initial node
- $t$ is called a target/terminal node

#### Definition (Coherent):

Two orientations to be the same is called *coherent*

---

Orientation (cont'd)
--------------------

Each object 

---

Node-edge Incidence Matrix
--------------------------

#### Definition (Incidence Matrix):

An $N \times M$ matrix $A^T$ is a node-edge incidence matrix with
entries:
$A(i,j) =  \begin{cases}  +1 & \text{if } e_i \text{ starts at node } v_j \,, \\  -1 & \text{if } e_i \text{ ends at node } v_j \,, \\  0 & \text{otherwise } \,.  \end{cases}$

#### Example:

$A^T = \begin{bmatrix}  0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\  1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\  -1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

---

Chain
-----

#### Definition (Chain $\tau$):

An edge/node *chain* $\tau$ is an $M$/$N$-tuple of scalar which assigns
a coefficient to each edge/node, where $M$/$N$ is the number of distinct
edges/nodes in the network.

#### Remark:

A chain may be viewed as an (oriented) indictor vector representing a
set of edges/nodes.

#### Example:

$[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]$, $[0, 0, 1, -1, 1]$

---

Discrete Boundary Operator
--------------------------

#### Definition (Boundary operator):

The *boundary* operator $\partial = A^T$.

#### Definition (Cycle):

A chain is called a *cycle* if it is in the nullspace of the boundary
operator, i.e. $A^T \tau = 0$

#### Definition (Boundary):

A chain $\beta$ is called a *boundary* of $\tau$ if it is in the range
of the boundary operator

---

Co-boundary Operator $\mathrm{d}$
---------------------------------

#### Definition (Co-boundary operator):

The *co-boundary* (or *differential*) operator
$\mathrm{d} = \partial^* = (A^T)^* = A$

#### Note:

Nullspace of $A$ is \#components of a graph

---

Disrete Stokes' Theorem
-----------------------

- Let $$\tau_i = \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } e_i \in S , \\
      0 & \text{otherwise} .
    \end{cases}$$
- Conventional (integration):
    $$\color{purple}{\int}_\color{red}{S} \color{green}{\mathrm{d}} \tilde{\omega} = \color{purple}{\oint}_{\color{blue}{\partial} \color{red}{S}} \tilde{\omega}$$
- Discrete (pairing):
    $$\color{purple}{[}\color{red}{\tau}, \color{green}{A}\omega\color{purple}{]} = \color{purple}{[}\color{blue}{A^T}\color{red}{\tau}, \omega\color{purple}{]}$$

---

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
-------------------------------

- Conventional (integration): $\int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) - F(a)$

- Discrete (pairing): $[\tau_1, A c^0] = [A^T\tau_1, c^0]$

Divergence and Flow
-------------------

#### Definition (Divergence):

$\text{div}\, x = A^T x$

#### Definition (Flow):

$x$ is called a *flow* if $\sum \text{div}\, x = 0$, where all positive
entries of (div $x$) are called *sources* and negative entries are
called *sinks*.

#### Definition (Circulation):

A network is called a *circulation* if there is no source or sink. In
other words, $\text{div}\, x = 0$

---

Tension and Potential
---------------------

#### Definition (Tension):

A tension (in co-domain) $y$ is a *differential* of a *potential* $u$,
i.e. $y= A u$.

#### Theorem (Tellgen's):

Flow and tension are bi-orthogonal (isomorphic).

#### Proof:

$0 = [A^T x, u] = (A^T x)^T u = x^T (A u) = x^T y$

---

Path
----

A path indicator vector $\tau$ of $P$ that $$\tau_i = 
                \begin{cases}
                   1 & \text{if } e_i \in P \,, \\
                   0 & \text{otherwise}\,.
                \end{cases}
$$

#### Theorem:

\[total tension $y$ on $P$\] = \[total potential on the boundary of
$P$\].

#### Proof:

$y^T \tau = (A u)^T \tau = u^T(A^T \tau) = u^T(\partial P)$.

---

Cut
---

Two node sets $S$ and $S'$ (the complement of $S$, i.e. $V - S$). A cut
$Q$ is an edge set, denoted by $[S, S']^-$. A cut indicator vector $q$
(oriented) of $Q$ is defined as $A c$ where $$c_i =
                \begin{cases}
                  1 & \text{if } v_i \in S \,, \\
                  0 & \text{otherwise}\,.
                \end{cases}
$$

#### Theorem (Stokes' theorem!):

\[total divergence of $x$ on $S$\] = \[total $x$ across $Q$\].

#### Proof:

$(\text{div}\,x)^T c = (A^T x)^T c = x^T (A c) = x^T q$.

Feasibility Problems
====================

---

Feasible Flow/Potential Problem
-------------------------------

.pull-left\[

Feasible Flow Problem

- Find a flow $x$ such that: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    c^- \leq x \leq c^+, \\
    A^T x = b, b(V) = 0.
    \end{array}$$

- Can be solved using:

    - Painted network algorithm

    - If no feasible solution, return a "negative cut".

\] .pull-right\[

Feasible Potential Problem:

- Find a potential $u$ such that: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    d^- \leq y \leq d^+  \\
    A \cdot u = y.
    \end{array}$$

- Can be solved using:

    - Bellman-Ford algorithm

    - If no feasible solution, return a "negative cycle".

\]

---

Examples
--------

Genome-scale reaction network (primal)

- $A$: Stoichiometric matrix $S$

- $x$: reactions between metabolites/proteins

- $c^- \leq x \leq c^+$: constraints on reaction rates

Timing constraints (co-domain)

- $A^T$: incidence matrix of timing constraint graph

- $u$: arrival time of clock

- $y$: clock skew

- $d^- \leq y \leq d^+$: setup- and hold-time constraints

---

Feasibility Flow Problem
------------------------

#### Theorem:

The problem has a feasible solution if and only if $b(S) \leq c^+(Q)$
for all cuts $Q = [S,S']$ where $c^+(Q)$ = upper capacity \[1, p.Â 56\].

#### Proof (if-part):

Let $q = A \cdot k$ be a cut vector (oriented) of $Q$. Then

  -----------------------
  \-
  $c^- \leq x \leq c^+$
  -----------------------
  \- $q^T x \leq c^+(Q)$
  -----------------------

- $(A \cdot k)^T x \leq c^+(Q)$

  -------------------------
  \-
  $k^T A^T x \leq c^+(Q)$
  -------------------------
  \- $k^T b \leq c^+(Q)$
  -------------------------

- $b(S) \leq c^+(Q)$

---

Feasibility Potential Problem
-----------------------------

#### Theorem:

The problem has a feasible solution if and only if $d^+(P) \geq 0$ for
all cycles $P$ where $d^+(P)$ = upper span \[1, p. ??\].

#### Proof (if-part):

Let $\tau$ be a path indicator vector (oriented) of $P$. Then

  ------------------------
  \- $d^- \leq y \leq d^+$
  ------------------------
                        \-
    $\tau^T y \leq d^+(P)$
  ------------------------

- $\tau^T (A \cdot u) \leq d^+(P)$

  --------------------------------
   \- $(A^T \tau)^T u \leq d^+(P)$
  --------------------------------
                                \-
    $(\partial P)^T u \leq d^+(P)$
  --------------------------------

- $0 \leq d^+(P)$

---

Remarks
-------

- The only-if part of the proof is constructive. It can be done by
    constructing an algorithm to obtain the feasible solution.

- $d^+$ could be $\infty$ or zero, etc.

- $d^-$ could be $-\infty$ or zero, etc.

- $c^+$ could be $\infty$ or zero, etc.

- $c^-$ could be $-\infty$ or zero, etc.

> Note: most tools require that $c^-$ must be zero such that the
> solution flow $x$ is always positive.

Convert to the elementary problem
---------------------------------

.pull-left\[

- By splitting every edges into two, the feasibility flow problem can
    reduce to an elementary one:

    - Find a flow $x$ such that $$\begin{array}{ll}
        c \leq x, \\
        A_1^T x = b_1, \\
        b_1(V_1) = 0.
        \end{array}$$

    where $A_1$ is the incident matrix of the modified network.

Basic Bellman-Ford Algorithm
----------------------------

``` {.matlab}
function BellmanFord(list vertices, list edges, vertex source)
   // Step 1: initialize graph
   for each vertex i in vertices:
       if i is source then u[i] := 0
       else u[i] := inf
       predecessor[i] := null

   // Step 2: relax edges repeatedly
   for i from 1 to size(vertices)-1:
       for each edge (i, j) with weight d in edges:
           if u[j] > u[i] + d[i,j]:
               u[j] := u[i] + d[i,j]
               predecessor[j] := i

   // Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles
   for each edge (i, j) with weight d in edges:
       if u[j] > u[i] + d[i,j]:
           error "Graph contains a negative-weight cycle"
   return u[], predecessor[]
```

                    pred[v] = u
    return None
```

\]

Example 1 : Clock skew scheduling
---------------------------------

- Goal: intentionally assign each register an arrival time $u_i$ such
    that the setup and hold time constraints are satistied.
- Note: the clock skew $y_{ij} = u_i - u_j$ is more important than the
    arrival time $u$ itself because clock is running periodically.
- At the eariler stage, fixing the timing violation could be done as
    soon as a negative cycle is detected. Complete timing analysis is
    not necessary at this stage.

---

Example 2 : Delay padding + clock skew scheduling
-------------------------------------------------

- Goal: intentionally "insert" delay $p$ for such that the setup and
    hold time constraints are satistied.
- Note that a delay can be "inserted" by swapping a fast transistor
    into a slower one.
- Traditional problem formulation: Find $p$ and $u$ such that

    $$\begin{array}{ll}
      y \leq d + p, \\
      A u = y, p \geq 0
    \end{array}$$

- Note 1: Inserting delay to some local paths may not be allowed.
- Note 2: the problem can be reduced to the standard form by modifing
    the network (timing constraint graph)

Four possible ways to insert delay
----------------------------------

No delay: ![](media/no_delay.svg)

$p_s = p_h$: ![](media/same_delay.svg)

\] .pull-right\[

Independent: ![](media/independent.svg)

$p_s \geq p_h$: ![](media/setup_greater.svg)

\]

---

Remarks
-------

- If there exists a negative cycle, it means that timing cannot be
    fixed using simply this technique.

- Additional constraints, such as $p_s \leq p_{\max}$, can be imposed.

Parametric Problems
===================

---

Parametric Potential Problem (PPP)
----------------------------------

- Consider a parameter potential problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{maximize}   & \beta \\
      \text{subject to} & y \leq d(\beta), \\
    & A \cdot u = y
    \end{array}$$ where $d(\beta)$ is a *monotonic decreasing* function.

- If $d(\beta)$ is a linear function $(m - \beta s)$ where $s$ is
    non-negative, the problem reduces to the well-known *minimum
    cost-to-time ratio problem*.

- If $s$ = constant, it further reduces to the *minimum mean cycle
    problem*.

> **Note:** Parametric flow problem can be defined similarly.

---

Examples
--------

- $d(\beta)$ is linear $(m - \beta s)$:

    - Optimal clock period scheduling problem

    - Slack maximization problem

    - Yield-driven clock skew scheduling (Gaussian)

- $d(\beta)$ is non-linear:

    - Yield-driven clock skew scheduling (non-Gaussian)

    - Multi-domain clock skew scheduling

---

Examples
--------

- Lawler's algorithm (binary search based)

- Howard's algorithm (cycle cancellation)

- Young's algorithm (path based)

- Burns' algorithm (path based)

    - for clock period optimization problem (all elements of $s$ are
        either 0 or 1)

- Several hybrid methods are also proposed

---

Remarks
-------

- Need to solve feasibility problems many time
- Data structures, such as Fibonacci heap or spanning tree/forest, may
    be used for efficiency
- For multi-parameter problems, the *ellipsoid method* can be used.
- Example 1: yield-driven clock skew scheduling (c.f. lecture 5)

---

Example 2: yield-driven delay padding
-------------------------------------

- Consider a parameter potential problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{maximize}   & \beta \\
    \text{subject to} & y \leq d - \beta s + p, \\
      & A \cdot u = y, p \geq 0
      \end{array}$$

- The problem can be reduced to the standard form by modifying the
    underlying constraint graph.

Min-cost Flow/Potenial Problem
==============================

---

Elementary Optimal Problems
---------------------------

- Elementary Flow Problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{min}   & d^T x + p \\
    \text{s. t.} & c \leq x, \\
      & A^T x = b, \; b(V)=0
      \end{array}$$

- Elementary Potential Problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{max}   & b^T u - (c^T y + q) \\
    \text{s. t.} & y \leq d, \\
      & A u = y
      \end{array}$$

---

Elementary Optimal Problems (Cont'd)
------------------------------------

- The problems are dual to each other if
    $p + q = -c^T d, (x - c)^T(d - y) = 0, c \leq x, y \leq d$

- Since $b^T u = (A^T x)^T u = x^T A u = x^T y,$
    $[\min]-[\max] = (d^T x + p) - (b^T u - [c^T y + q])$ \$ = d\^T x +
    c\^T y - x\^T y + p + q = (x - c)\^T(d - y) \geq 0\$

- $[\min] - [\max]$ when equality holds.

---

Remark
------

- We can formulate a linear problem either in its primal form or in
    its dual form, depending on which solving method is more
    appropriate:

    - Improve feasible solutions incrementally

    - Design variables are in integral domain:

        - max-flow problem (i.e. $d^T = [-1, -1, \cdots, -1]^T$) may
            be better to be solved by a dual method.

---

Linear Optimal Problems
-----------------------

- Optimal Flow Problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{min}   & d^T x + p \\
    \text{s. t.} & c^- \leq x \leq c^+, \\
      & A^T x = b, \; b(V)=0
      \end{array}$$

- Optimal Potential Problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{max}   & b^T u - (c^T y + q) \\
    \text{s. t.} & d^- \leq y \leq d^+, \\
      & A u = y
      \end{array}$$

---

Linear Optimal Problems
-----------------------

By modifying the network:

- This problem can be reduced to the elementary case \[pp.275-276\]

- Piecewise linear convex cost can be reduced to this linear problem
    \[p.239,p.260\]

The problem has been studied extensively with a lot of applications.

---

Remark
------

- We can transform the cost function to be non-negative by reversing
    the orientation of the negative cost edges.

- Then reduce the problem to the elementary case (or should we???)

---

Algorithms for Optimal Flow Problems
------------------------------------

- Successive shortest path algorithm

- Cycle cancellation method

    - iteratively insert additional minimal flows according to a
        negative cycle of the residual network, until no negative cycle
        is found.

- Scaling method

---

For Special Cases
-----------------

- Max flow problem ($d = -[1, \cdots, 1]$)

    - Ford-Fulkerson algorithm: iteratively insert additional minimal
        flows according to an argument path of the residual network,
        until no argument path of the residual network, until no
        argument path is found.

    - Preflow Push-Relabel algorithm (dual method???)

- Matching problems ($[c^-, c^+] = [0, 1]$)

    - Edmond's blossom algorithm

---

Min-Cost Flow Problem (MCFP)
----------------------------

- Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{min}   & d^T x \\
    \text{s. t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^T x = b, \; b(V)=0
      \end{array}$$ where $d$ is assumed to be non-negative.

- Algorithm idea: descent method: given a feasible $x_0$, find a
    better solution $x_1 = x_0 + \alpha p$, where $\alpha$ is positive.

---

General Descent Method
----------------------

- **Input**: $f(x)$, initial $x$
- **Output**: optimal opt $x^*$
- **while** not converged,
    1.  Choose descent direction $p$;
    2.  Choose the step size $\alpha$;
    3.  $x := x + \alpha p$;

---

Some Common Descent Directions
------------------------------

- Gradient descent: $p = -\nabla f(x)^T$
- Steepest descent:
    - $\triangle x_{nsd}$ = argmin$\{\nabla f(x)^T v \mid \|v\|=1 \}$
    - $\triangle x_{sd}$ = $\|\nabla f(x)\| \triangle x_{nsd}$
        (un-normalized)
- Newton's method: $p = -\nabla^2 f(x)^{-1} \nabla f(x)$
- For convex problems, must satisfy $\nabla f(x)^T p < 0$.

> **Note:** Here, there is a natural way to choose $p$!

---

Min-Cost Flow Problem (MCFP)
----------------------------

- Let $x_1 = x_0 + \alpha p$, then we have: $$\begin{array}{lll}
    \text{min}   & d^T x_0 + \alpha d^T p  & \Rightarrow d^T p < 0 \\
    \text{s. t.} & -x_0 \leq \alpha p \leq c-x_0 & \Rightarrow \text{residual graph} \\
      & A^T p = 0 & \Rightarrow p \text{ is a cycle!}
      \end{array}$$

- In other words, choose $p$ to be a negative cycle!

    - Simple negative cycle, or

    - Minimum mean cycle

---

Primal Method for MCFP
----------------------

- **Input**: $G(V,E), [c^-, c^+], d$
- **Output**: optimal opt $x^*$
- Initialize a feasible $x$ and certain data structure
- **while** a negative cycle $p$ found in $G(x)$,
    1.  Choose a step size $\alpha$;
    2.  **If** $\alpha$ is unbounded, **return** UNBOUNDED;
    3.  **If** $\alpha = 0$, **break**;
    4.  $x := x + \alpha p$;
    5.  Update corresponding data structures
- **return** OPTIMAL

---

Remarks
-------

- In Step 4, negative cycle can be found using Bellman-Ford algorithm.

- In the cycle cancelling algorithm, $p$ is:

    - a simple negative cycle, or

    - a minimum mean cycle

- A heap or other data structures are used for finding negative cycles
    efficiently.

- Usually $\alpha$ is chosen such that one constraint is tight.

Min-Cost Potential Problem (MCPP)
---------------------------------

- Problem Formulation: $$\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{min}   & c^T y \\
    \text{s. t.} & y \leq d, \\
      & A u = y
      \end{array}$$ where $c$ is assumed to be non-negative.

- Algorithm: given an initial feasible $u_0$, find a better solution
    $u_1 = u_0 + \beta q$, where $\beta$ is positive:
    $$\begin{array}{lll}
    \text{min}   & c^T y_0 + c^T y  & \Rightarrow c^T y < 0 \\
    \text{s. t.} & y \leq d - A u_0 & \Rightarrow \text{residual graph} \\
      & \beta A q = y    & \Rightarrow q \; \text{is a ``cut''!}
      \end{array}$$

---

Method for MCPP
---------------

- **Input**: $G(V,E), c, d$
- **Output**: optimal opt $u^*$
- Initialize a feasible $u$ and certain data structure
- **while** a negative cut $q$ found in $G(u)$,
    1.  Choose a step size $\beta$;
    2.  **If** $\beta$ is unbounded, **return** UNBOUNDED;
    3.  **If** $\beta = 0$, **break**;
    4.  $u := u + \beta q$;
    5.  Update corresponding data structures
- **return** OPTIMAL

---

Remarks
-------

- Usually $\beta$ is chosen such that one constraint is tight.

- Min-cost potential problem is a dual of min-cost flow problem, hence
    algorithms can solve both problems.

- In the network simplex method, $q$ is chosen from a spanning tree
    data structure (only for linear problems)

E.g. Delay Padding
------------------

- Consider the following problem: $$\begin{array}{ll}
       \text{min}  & c^T p, \\
       \text{s.t.} & y \leq d + p, \\
       & A u = y, \; p \geq 0
       \end{array}$$ where $p$: delay padding

- Its dual is: $$\begin{array}{ll}
      \text{min}   & d^T x  \\
      \text{s.t.} & 0 \leq x \leq c, \\
      & A^T x = 0
    \end{array}$$
