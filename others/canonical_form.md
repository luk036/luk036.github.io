# Canonical form (CF)

## Why

Example: Polygon: clockwise vs. anticlockwise

- Need to handle two possibilities
- Canonical form can reduce code complexity

## Examples

Linear Programming

   min {c'x | A x = b, x >= 0}
   min (c'x | A x >= b, x >= 0)

Boolean Expression

- Sum-of-product: (!X)YZ + X(!Y)Z + XY(!Z)

Fraction

- CF: 3 / 4, -2 / 5
- Non-CF: 6 / 8, 2 / -5

Rectilinear polygon

- x first, then y
- remove half of the points
- even make some algorithms simpler

## Requirements

- Without loss of generality
