---

## Definition

- Global routing vs. detail routing

  1. Generate Steiner points
  2. Steiner point guided detail routing
  3. Congestion Estimation for global placement

---

## Point-to-Point

- Maze routing

- Pathfinding

---

## Multi-terminal Single Net

- Wirelength driven (power driven)

  - Rectilinear Minimum Steiner Tree

- Timing driven

- Routability driven

---

## All Nets

- Rip-up and Reroute
