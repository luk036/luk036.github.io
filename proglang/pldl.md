# ☯ Primal-dual Approximation Algorithms

@luk036 👨‍💻

---

## Motivation

- For Large-scale NP-hard problems
- Optimal solution is not required
- 📚 Example: clustering problem for multi-level circuit partitioning

- Pros:
  - Fast (without sorting)
  - Simple
  - More flexible
  - Often give you a performance guarantee
- Cons:
  - Low quality

---

## Graph/Hypergraph

- View netlist as hypergraph
- Weights are non-negative

---

## Graph Covering problems

- Minimum Vertex Cover (vs. Greedy algorithm)
- Minimum Cycle Cover
- Minimum Odd-Cycle Cover (Graph bipartitization)

---

- Minimum Maximal Independent/Matching
- Minimum Steiner Tree/Forest
- Facility Location Problems
