Projective Geometry
===================

Introduction
------------

---

### Geometry and Algebra

-   Geometry
    -   Points, lines, triangles, circles, conic sections...
    -   Collinear, concurrent, parallel, perpendicular...
    -   Distances, angles, areas, quadrance, spread, quadrea...
    -   Midpoint, bisector, orthocenter, pole/polar, tangent...
-   Algebra
    -   Addition, multiplication, inverse...
    -   Elementary algebra: integer/rational/real/complex... numbers.
    -   Abstract Algebra: rings, fields...
    -   Linear algebra: vector, matrix, determinant, dot/cross product...
-   Two subjects are related by coordinates.

---

### Key points

-   Our earth is not flat and our universe is non-Euclidean.

-   Non-Euclidean geometry is much easier to learn than you might think.

-   Our curriculum in school is completely wrong.

-   Euclidean geometry is non-symmetric. Three sides determine a triangle, but three angles do not determine a triangle. It might not be true in general geometries. Euclidean geometry is just a special case.

-   Yet Euclidean geometry is more computationally efficient and is still used in our small-scale daily life.

-   Incidenceship promotes integer arithmetic; non-oriented measurement promotes rational arithmetic; oriented measurement promotes floating-point arithmetic. Don't use a machine gun to hunt rabbit.

Projective Plane's Basic Elements
---------------------------------

---

### Projective Plane Concept

-   Only involve "Points" and "Lines".

-   "Points" (or "lines") are assumed to be distinguishable.

-   Denote $A$ = $B$ as $A$ and $B$ are referred to the same point.

-   E.g., $(1/3, 2/3)$ = $(10/30, 20/30)$

-   We have the following rules:
    -   $A$ = $A$ (reflective)
    -   If $A$ = $B$, then $B$ = $A$ (symmetric)
    -   If $A$ = $B$ and $B$ = $C$, then $A = C$ (transitive)
-   Unless mention specifically, objects in different names are assumed to be distinct, i.e. $A \neq B$.

-   The idea can be generalized to higher dimensions. However, we restrict to 2D only here.

---

### Incidence

-   A point either lies on a line or not.

-   If a point $A$ lies on a line $l$, denote $l \circ A$.

-   For convenience, we also denote as $A \circ l$.

-   We have $A \circ l = l \circ A$

---

### Projective Point and Line

-   Projective Point
    -   Exactly one line passes through two distinct points.
    -   Denote join($A$, $B$) or simply $AB$ as a line joined by $A$ and $B$.
    -   We have:
        -   $AB$ = $BA$
        -   $AB \circ A$ and $AB \circ B$ are always true.
-   Projective Line
    -   Exactly one point met by two distinct lines.
    -   Denote meet($l$, $m$) or simply $l m$ as a point met by $l$ and $m$.
    -   We have:
        -   $lm$ = $ml$
        -   $lm \circ l$ and $lm \circ m$ are always true.
-   Duality: "Point" and "Line" are interchangable here.

-   "Projective geometry is all geometry." (Arthur Cayley)

---

### Example 1: Euclidean Geometry

-   Point: projection of a 3D vector $p = [x, y, z]$ to 2D plane $z = 1$:
    $$(x', y') = (x/z, y/z)$$

-   $[\alpha x, \alpha y, \alpha z]$ for all $\alpha \neq 0$ are representing the same point.

-   For instance, $[1, 5, 6]$ and $[-10, -50, -60]$ are representing the same point $(1/6, 5/6)$

-   $p_\infty = [x, y, 0]$ is a point at *infinity*.

-   Line: $a x' + b y' + c = 0$, denoted by a vector $[a, b, c]$.

-   $[\alpha a, \alpha b, \alpha c]$ for all $\alpha \neq 0$ are representing the same line.

-   $l_\infty = [0, 0, 1]$ is the line at *infinity*.

-   $[0, 0, 0]$ is not a valid point or line.

---

### Euclidean 2D plane from 3D vector

![](figs/euclidean.png){#fig:euclidean}

---

### Calculation by Vector Operations

-   Let $v_1 = [x_1, y_1, z_1]$ and $v_2 = [x_2, y_2, z_2]$.
    -   dot product $v_1 \cdot v_2$ = $v_1^T v_2$ = $x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2$.
    -   cross product $v_1 \times v_2$ = $[y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2, -x_1 z_2 + z_1 x_2, x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2]$

-   Then, we have:
    -   $A \circ a$ if and only if $[A] \cdot [a] = 0$
    -   Join of two points: $[AB]$ = $[A] \times [B]$
    -   Meet of two lines: $[lm]$ = $[l] \times [m]$
    -   $A = B$ if and only if $[A] \times [B] = [0, 0, 0]$

---

### Examples

-   The linear equation that joins the point $(1/2, 3/2)$ and $(4/5, 3/5)$ is $[1, 3, 2] \times [4, 3, 5]$ = $[9, 3, -9]$, or $9x + 3y - 9 = 0$, or $3x + y = 3$.

-   The point $(1/2, 3/2)$ lies on the line $3x + y = 3$ because $[1, 3, 2]\cdot [3, 1, -3]$ = $0$.

-   Exercise: Calculate the line equation that joins the points $(5/8, 7/8)$ and $(-5/6, 1/6)$.

### Python Code (pg_point)

```python
import numpy as np

class pg_point(np.ndarray):
    def __new__(cls, inputarr):
        obj = np.asarray(inputarr).view(cls)
        return obj

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if type(other) is type(self):
            return (np.cross(self, other) == 0).all()
        return False

    def incident(self, l):
        return not self.dot(l)

    def __mul__(self, other):
        ''' join '''
        return pg_line(np.cross(self, other))

def join(p, q):
    return p * q
```

---

### Python Code (pg_line)

```python
import numpy as np

class pg_line(np.ndarray):
    def __new__(cls, inputarr):
        obj = np.asarray(inputarr).view(cls)
        return obj

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if type(other) is type(self):
            return (np.cross(self, other) == 0).all()
        return False

    def incident(self, p):
        return not self.dot(p)

    def __mul__(self, other):
        ''' meet '''
        return pg_point(np.cross(self, other))

def meet(l, m):
    return l * m
```

---

### Python Code (Example)

```python
from __future__ import print_function
from pprint import pprint
import numpy as np

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = pg_point([1, 3, 2])
    q = pg_point([4, 3, 5])
    print(join(p, q))

    l = pg_line([5, 7, 8])
    m = pg_line([-5, 1, 6])
    print(meet(l, m))

    p = pg_point([1-2j, 3-1j, 2+1j]) # complex number
    q = pg_point([-2+1j, 1-3j, -1-1j])
    assert p.incident(p*q)
```

---

### Example 2: Perspective View of Euclidean Geometry

-   It turns out that we can choose any line on a plane as the line of infinity.

![](figs/euclidean2.svg){#fig:euclidean2}

---

### Example 3: Spherical/Elliptic Geometry

-   Surprisingly, the vector notations and operators can also represent other geometries such as spherical/Elliptic geometry.

-   "Point": projection of 3D vector $[x, y, z]$ to the unit sphere.
    $$(x', y', z') = (x/r, y/r, z/r)$$ where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.

-   Two points on the opposite poles are considered the same point here.

-   "Line": $[a, b, c]$ represents the *great circle* intersected by the unit sphere and the plane $a x + b y + c z= 0$.

-   $[x, y, z]$ is called *Homogeneous Coordinates*.

-   Here, the coordinates could be in integer numbers, rational numbers (ratio of two integers), real numbers, complex numbers, or finite field numbers, or even polynomial functions.

---

### Spherical Geometry from 3D vector

![](figs/sphere.png){#fig:sphere}

---

### Example 4: Hyperbolic Geometry from 3D vector

-   A velocity "point": projection of a 3D vector $[p] = [x, y, t]$ to 2D plane $t = 1$:
    $$(v_x, v_y) = (x/t, y/t)$$

---

### Counter-examples

-   In some quorum systems, two "lines" are allowed to meet at more than one points. Therefore, only the very special case it is a projective geometry.

-   In some systems, a line from $A$ to $B$ is not the same as the line from $B$ to $A$, so they cannot form a projective geometry.

-   "Symmetry" is an important keyword in projective geometry.

---

### Number systems

-   Integer number ($\mathbb{Z}$):
    -   e.g. $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, -1, -2, -3, \ldots$
    -   discrete, more computationally efficient.
-   Rational number ($\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Z}]$):
    -   e.g. $0/1, 2/3, -1/3, 1/0$ (i.e. infinity)
    -   Multiplication/division is easier than addition/subtraction
-   Real number ($\mathbb{R}$):
    -   e.g. $0.3$, $2^{1/2}$, $\pi$
    -   May induce round-off errors.
-   Finite field, $GF(n)$, where $n$ is a prime number (e.g. $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$) or prime powers (e.g. $4=2^2, 8=2^3, 9=3^2$).
    -   Used in Coding Theory

---

### Number systems (cont'd)

-   Complex number ($\mathbb{C}$):
    -   e.g $1 + \pi i$, $1 - 3\pi i$
    -   Besides the identity (the only automorphism of the real numbers), there is also the automorphism $\tau$ that sends $x + i y$ to $x - iy$ such that $\tau(\tau(x)) = x$.
-   Complex number over integer ($\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}]$)
    -   e.g. $1 + 2 i$, $1 - 2 i$
    -   Also known as Gaussian integer.
-   Complex number over Rational ($\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Q}]$)

-   Projective Geometry can work on all these number systems.

-   In fact, Projective Geometry can work on any field number. Moreover, the multiplicative inverse is not required. 

-   "Continuity" is not assumed in Projective Geometry.

---

### Example 4: Poker Card Geometry

-   Even "coordinates" is **not** a necessary requirement of projective geometry.

-   Consider the poker cards in @tbl:poker_card:

    -   For example, meet($l_2, l_5$) = `5`, join(`J`, `4`) = $l_8$.

-   We call this *Poker Card Geometry* here.

### Finite projective plane

-   Yet we may assign the homogeneous coordinate to a finite projective plane, where the vector operations are in a finite field.

-   E.g. The poker card geometry is a finite projective plane of order 3.

-   The smallest finite projective plane (order 2) contains only 7 points and 7 lines.

-   If the order is a prime number or prime powers, then we can easily construct the finite projective plane via finite field and homogeneous coordinate.

-   The non-existence of finite projective plane of order 10 was proved in 1989. The proof took the equivalent of 2000 hours on a Cray 1 supercomputer.

-   The existences of many other higher order finite projective planes are still an open question.

---

### Not covered in this work

-   Unless mention specifically, we don't discuss finite projective plane further more.

-   Although the coordinate system is not a requirement in general projective geometry, practically all examples we are dealing with have homogeneous coordinates. All the proofs of theorems are based on the assumption of homogeneous coordinates.

Basic Properties
----------------

---

### Collinear, Concurrent, and Coincidence

-   Three points are called *collinear* if they all lie on the same line.

-   Three lines are called *concurrent* if they all meet at the same point.

-   Denote coincidence relation as coI($A,B,C$).

-   coI($A,B,C$) is true if and only if $AB \circ C$ is true.

-   Similarly, coI($a,b,c$) is true if and only if $ab \circ c$ is true.

-   In general, coI($A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$) is true if and only if $A_1 A_2 \circ X$ is true for all $X$ in the rest of points $A_3, A_4, \ldots, A_n$.

-   Unless mention specifically, $ABCD\ldots$ is assumed to be coincidence, while $\{ABCD\ldots\}$ is assumed none of three are coincident.

---

### Parameterize a line

-   The points on the line $AB$ can be parameterized by $\lambda [A] + \mu [B]$ with $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are not both zero.

-   For integer coordinates, to show that $\lambda [A] + \mu [B]$ can span all the integer points on the line, we give the exact expression of $\lambda/\mu$ of a point $C$ as follows.

-   Let $l = [C] \times ([A] \times [B])$. 

-   Then $$\lambda [A] + \mu [B] = (l^T [B]) [A] - (l^T [A]) [B]$$

---

### Python Code

```python
def coI_core(l, Lst):
    for p in Lst:
        if not l.incident(p):
            return False
    return True

def coI(Lst):
    if len(Lst) < 3:
        return True
    [p, q] = Lst[0:2]
    assert p != q
    return coI_core(p*q, Lst[2:])

# note: `lambda` is a preserved keyword in python
def pk_point(lambda1, p, mu1, q):
    return pg_point(lambda1 * p + mu1 * q)

def pk_line(lambda1, l, mu1, m):
    return pg_line(lambda1 * l + mu1 * m)
```

---

### Pappus Theorem

-   Theorem (Pappus): Given two lines $ABC$ and $DEF$. Let $G$=meet($AE,BD$), $H$=meet($AF,CD$), $I$=meet($BF,CE$). Then $G,H,I$ are collinear.

-   Sketch of the *proof*:
    -   Let $[C] = \lambda_1 [A] + \mu_1 [B]$.
    -   Let $[F] = \lambda_2 [D] + \mu_2 [E]$.
    -   Express $[G], [H], [I]$ in terms of $[A], [B], \lambda_1, \mu_1, \lambda_2, \mu_2$.
    -   Simplify the expression $[G] \cdot ([H] \times [I])$ and derive that it is equal to 0. (we may use the Python's symbolic package for the calculation.)
-   Exercise: verify that this theorem holds for the poker card geometry with `3`, `6`, `Q` on $l_3$ and `8`, `9`, `J` on $l_8$.

### Python Code for the Proof

```python
    import sympy
    sympy.init_printing()
    pv = sympy.symbols("p:3", integer=True)
    qv = sympy.symbols("q:3", integer=True)
    lambda1, mu1 = sympy.symbols("lambda1 mu1", integer=True)
    p = pg_point(pv)
    q = pg_point(qv)
    r = pk_point(lambda1, p, mu1, q)
    sv = sympy.symbols("s:3", integer=True)
    tv = sympy.symbols("t:3", integer=True)
    lambda2, mu2 = sympy.symbols("lambda2 mu2", integer=True)
    s = pg_point(sv)
    t = pg_point(tv)
    u = pk_point(lambda2, s, mu2, t)
    G = meet(join(p, t), join(q, s))
    H = meet(join(p, u), join(r, s))
    I = meet(join(q, u), join(r, t))
    ans = np.dot(G, join(H, I))
    ans = sympy.simplify(ans)
    print(ans) # get 0
```

### Triangles and Trilaterals

-   If three points $A$, $B$, and $C$ are not collinear, they form a triangle, denoted as $\{ABC\}$.

-   If three lines $a$, $b$, and $c$ are not concurrent, they form a trilateral, denoted as $\{abc\}$.

-   Triangle $\{ABC\}$ and trilateral $\{abc\}$ are dual if $A = bc$, $B = ac$ and $C = ab$.

Projectivities and Perspectivities
----------------------------------

---

### Projectivities

-   An ordered set $(A,B,C)$ (either collinear or not) is called a projective of a concurrent set $abc$ if and only if $A \circ a$, $B \circ b$ and $C \circ c$.

-   Denote this as $(A,B,C)$ $\barwedge$ $abc$.

-   An ordered set $(a,b,c)$ (either concurrent or not) is called a projective of a collinear set $ABC$ if and only if $A \circ a$, $B \circ b$ and $C \circ c$.

-   Denote this as $(a,b,c)$ $\barwedge$ $ABC$.

-   If each ordered set is coincident, we may write:

    -   $ABC$ $\barwedge$ $abc$ $\barwedge$ $A'B'C'$

    -   Or simply $ABC$ $\barwedge$ $A'B'C'$

---

### Perspectivities

-   An ordered set $(A,B,C)$ is called a perspectivity of an ordered set $(A', B', C')$ if and only if $(A,B,C)$ $\barwedge$ $abc$ and $(A', B', C')$ $\barwedge$ $abc$ for some concurrent set $abc$.

-   Denote this as $(A, B, C)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(A', B', C')$.

-   An ordered set $(a,b,c)$ is called a perspectivity of an ordered set $(a', b', c')$ if and only if $(a,b,c)$ $\barwedge$ $ABC$ and $(a',b',c')$ $\barwedge$ $ABC$ for some collinear set $ABC$.

-   Denote this as $(a,b,c)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(a', b', c')$.

### An instance of perspectivity

![](figs/perspec.svg){#fig:perspec}

---

### Another instance of perspectivity

![](figs/perspec2.svg){#fig:perspec2}

---

### Perspectivity

-   Similar definition for more than three points:

    -   $(A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots,A_n)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(A_1',A_2',A_3',\ldots,A_n')$.

-   To check perspectivity:

    -   First construct a point $O$ := meet($A_1 A_1', A_2 A_2'$).

    -   For the rest of points, check if $X, X', O$ are collinear.

-   Note that $(A,B,C)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(D,E,F)$ and $(D,E,F)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(G,H,I)$ does not imply $(A,B,C)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(G,H,I)$.

---

### Python Code 

```python
def persp(L, M):
    if len(L) != len(M):
        return False
    if len(L) < 3:
        return True
    [pL, qL] = L[0:2]
    [pM, qM] = M[0:2]
    assert pL != qL 
    assert pM != qM
    assert pL != pM
    assert qL != qM
    O = (pL * pM) * (qL * qM)
    for rL, rM in zip(L[2:], M[2:]):
        if not O.incident(rL * rM):
            return False
    return True
```

---

### Desargues's Theorem

-   Theorem (Desargues): Let trilateral $\{abc\}$ be the dual of triangle $\{ABC\}$ and trilateral $\{a'b'c'\}$ be the dual of triangle $\{A'B'C'\}$. Then, $\{ABC\}$ $\doublebarwedge$ $\{A'B'C'\}$ if and only if $\{abc\}$ $\doublebarwedge$ $\{a'b'c'\}$.
-   Sketch of the *proof*:
    -   Let $O$ be the perspective point.
    -   Let $[A'] = \lambda_1 [A] + \mu_1 [O]$.
    -   Let $[B'] = \lambda_2 [B] + \mu_2 [O]$.
    -   Let $[C'] = \lambda_3 [C] + \mu_3 [O]$.
    -   Let $[G]$ = meet(join($[A],[B]$),join($[A'],[B']$))
    -   Let $[H]$ = meet(join($[B],[C]$),join($[B'],[C']$))
    -   Let $[I]$ = meet(join($[A],[C]$),join($[A'],[C']$))
    -   Express $[G], [H], [I]$ in terms of $[A], [B], [C], [O], \lambda_1, \mu_1, \lambda_2, \mu_2, \lambda_3, \mu_3$.
    -   Simplify the expression $[G] \cdot ([H] \times [I])$ and find that it is equal to 0. (we may use the Python's symbolic package for the calculation.)
    -   Due to the duality, the only-if part can be proved using the same technique.

### Projective Transformation

- Given a function $\tau$ that transforms a point $A$ to another point $\tau(A)$. 

- If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear and we always have $\tau(A)$, $\tau(B)$, and $\tau(C)$ collinear. Then the function $\tau$ is called a projective transformation.

- In Homogeneous coordinate, a projective transformation is any non-singular matrix times a vector.

### Quadrangles and Quadrilateral Sets

-   If four points $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $S$ none of three are collinear, they form a quadrangle, denoted as $\{PQRS\}$.

-   Note that Quadrangle here could be convex or self-intersecting.

-   Totally there are six lines formed by $\{PQRS\}$.

-   Assume they meet another line $l$ at $A, B, C, D, E, F$, where

    -   $A$ = meet($PQ, l$), $D$ = meet($RS, l$)

    -   $B$ = meet($QR, l$), $E$ = meet($PS, l$)

    -   $C$ = meet($PR, l$), $F$ = meet($QS, l$)

-   We call the six points as a quadrilateral set, denoted as $(AD)(BE)(CF)$.

### Harmonic Sets

-   In a quadrilateral set $(AD)(BE)(CF)$, if $A=D$ and $B=E$, then it is called a harmonic set.

-   The Harmonic relation is denoted by $H(AB, CF)$.

-   Then $C$ and $F$ is called a harmonic conjugate.

-   Theorem: If $ABCF$ $\barwedge$ $abcd$, then $H(AB, CF) = H(ab, cf)$.

-   In other words, projectivity preserves harmonic relation.

-   Theorem: If $ABCF$ $\doublebarwedge$ $A'B'C'F'$, then $H(AB, CF) = H(A'B', C'F')$.

-   In other words, perspectivity preserves harmonic relation.

### Basic measure between point and line

- A basic measure between $p$ and $l$, denoted by $p\cdot l$ (inner product):

  - $p \cdot l$ can be positive, negative, and zero.

  - $p \cdot l = 0$ if and only if $p$ lies on $l$.

---

### Cross Ratio

- Given a line incident with $ABCD$. Arbitrary choose a point $O$ not on the line.

- The cross ratio is defined as:

  $$R(A, B; C, D) = (OA \cdot C)(OB \cdot D)/(OA \cdot D)(OB \cdot C)$$

- Note: the cross ratio does not depend on what $O$ is chosen.

---

### Python Code

```python
from fractions import *
import numpy as np

def dot(p, l):
    return np.dot(p, l)

def x_ratio(A, B, l, m):
    dAl = dot(A, l)
    dAm = dot(A, m)
    dBl = dot(B, l)
    dBm = dot(B, m)
    if isinstance(dAl, int):
        return Fraction(dAl, dAm) / Fraction(dBl, dBm)
    else:
        return dAl*dBm/(dAm*dBl)

def R(A, B, C, D):
    O = (C*D).aux()
    return x_ratio(A, B, O*C, O*D)
```

### Polarities

-   A *polarity* is a projective correlation of period 2.

-   We call $a$ the *polar* of $A$, and $A$ the pole of $a$.

-   Denote $a = A^\perp$ and $A = a^\perp$.

-   Except degenerate cases, $A = (A^\perp)^\perp$ and $a = (a^\perp)^\perp$.

-   It may happen that $A$ is incident with $a$ so that each is *self-conjugate*.

-   The locus of self-conjugate points defines a *conic*. However, the polarity is a more general concept than a conic, because some polarities may not have self-conjugate points (or their self-conjugate points are complex).

---

### The Use of a Self-Polar Triangle

-   Any projective correlation that relates the three vertices of one triangle to the respectively opposite sides is a polarity.

-   Thus, any triangle $\{ABC\}$, any point $P$ not on a side, and any line $p$ not throughout a vertex, determine a definite polarity $(ABC)(Pp)$.

---

### The Conic

-   Historically *ellipse* (including *circle*), *parabola*, and *hyperbola*.

-   The locus of self-conjugate points is a *conic*.

-   Their polars are its *tangents*.

-   Any other line is called a *secant* or a *nonsecant* according to as it meets the conic twice or not at all, i.e., according to as the involution of conjugate points on it is hyperbolic or elliptic.

-   Note: Intersecting a conic with a line may result of an irrational intersection point.

### Construct the polar of a point using a conic

-   To construct the polar of a given point $C$, not on the conic, draw any two secants $PQ$ and $RS$ through $C$; then the polar joins the two points meet($QR, PS$) and meet($RP, QS$).

### Construct the pole from a line
