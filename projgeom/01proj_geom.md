## 🔑 Key points

- The earth is not flat and our universe is non-Euclidean.

- Non-Euclidean geometry is much easier to learn than you might think.

- Our curriculum in school is completely wrong.

- Euclidean geometry is asymmetric. Three sides determine a triangle, but three angles do not determine a triangle. This may not the case in general geometries. Euclidean geometry is just a special case.

- Yet Euclidean geometry is computationally more efficient and is still used in our small-scale everyday life.

- Incidenceship facilitates integer arithmetic; non-oriented measurement facilitates rational arithmetic; oriented measurement facilitates floating-point arithmetic. Don't shoot rabbits with machine guns.

## The Basic Elements of Projective Plane

---

### The concept of Projective Plane

- Only "points" and "lines" are involved.

- Assume that "points" (or "lines") are distinguishable.

- Denote $A$ = $B$ as $A$ and $B$ refer to the same point.

- E.g., $(1/3, 2/3)$ = $(10/30, 20/30)$

- We have the following rules:

  - $A$ = $A$ (reflective)
  - If $A$ = $B$, then $B$ = $A$ (symmetric)
  - If $A$ = $B$ and $B$ = $C$, then $A = C$ (transitive)

- Unless otherwise mentioned, objects with different names are assumed to be distinct, i.e. $A \neq B$.

- This idea can be generalized to higher dimensions. However, we restrict here to 2D only.

---

### Incidence

- A point either lies on a line or it does not.

- If a point $A$ lies on a line $l$, denote $l \circ A$.

- For convenience, we also denote it as $A \circ l$.

- We have $A \circ l = l \circ A$

![Incidence](figs/pg_object.svg)

---

### Projective Point and Line

- Projective Point

  - Exactly one line passes through two distinct points.
  - Denote join($A$, $B$) or simply $AB$ as a line joined by $A$ and $B$.
  - We have:
    - $AB$ = $BA$
    - $AB \circ A$ and $AB \circ B$ are always true.

- Projective Line

  - Exactly one point met by two distinct lines.
  - Denote meet($l$, $m$) or simply $l m$ as a point met by $l$ and $m$.
  - We have:
    - $lm$ = $ml$
    - $lm \circ l$ and $lm \circ m$ are always true.

- Duality: "Point" and "Line" are interchangable here.

- "Projective geometry is all geometry." (Arthur Cayley)

---

### Example 1: Euclidean Geometry

- Point: projection of a 3D vector $p = [x, y, z]$ onto a 2D plane $z = 1$: $$(x', y') = (x/z, y/z)$$

- $[\alpha x, \alpha y, \alpha z]$ for all $\alpha \neq 0$ represents the same point.

- For instance, $[1, 5, 6]$ and $[-10, -50, -60]$ represent the same point $(1/6, 5/6)$

- $p_\infty = [x, y, 0]$ is a point at _infinity_.

- Line: $a x' + b y' + c = 0$, denoted by a vector $[a, b, c]$.

- $[\alpha a, \alpha b, \alpha c]$ for all $\alpha \neq 0$ represents the same line.

- $l_\infty = [0, 0, 1]$ is the line at _infinity_.

- $[0, 0, 0]$ is not a valid point or line.

---

### Euclidean 2D plane from 3D vector

![euclidean](figs/euclidean.png){#fig:euclidean}

---

### Calculation by Vector Operations

- Let $v_1 = [x_1, y_1, z_1]$ and $v_2 = [x_2, y_2, z_2]$.
  - Dot product $v_1 \cdot v_2$ = $v_1^\mathsf{T} v_2$ = $x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2$.
  - Cross product $v_1 \times v_2$ = $[y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2, -x_1 z_2 + z_1 x_2, x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2]$
- Then, we have:
  - $A \circ a$ precisely when $[A] \cdot [a] = 0$
  - Join of two points: $[AB]$ = $[A] \times [B]$
  - Meet of two lines: $[lm]$ = $[l] \times [m]$
  - $A = B$ precisely when $[A] \times [B] = [0, 0, 0]$

---

### Examples

- The linear equation that joins the point $(1/2, 3/2)$ and $(4/5, 3/5)$ is $[1, 3, 2] \times [4, 3, 5]$ = $[9, 3, -9]$, or $9x + 3y - 9 = 0$, or $3x + y = 3$.

- The point $(1/2, 3/2)$ lies on the line $3x + y = 3$ because $[1, 3, 2]\cdot [3, 1, -3]$ = $0$.

- Exercise: Calculate the line equation that joins the points $(5/8, 7/8)$ and $(-5/6, 1/6)$.

### Example 2: Perspective View of Euclidean Geometry

- It turns out that we can choose any line in a plane as the line of infinity.

![euclidean2](figs/euclidean2.svg){#fig:euclidean2}

---

### Example 3: Spherical/Elliptic Geometry

- Surprisingly, the vector notations and operators can also represent other geometries, such as spherical/Elliptic geometry.

- "Point": projection of the 3D vector $[x, y, z]$ onto the unit sphere.
  $$(x', y', z') = (x/r, y/r, z/r)$$
  where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.

- Here, the two points on the opposite poles are considered to be the same point.

- "Line": $[a, b, c]$ represents the _great circle_ intersecting the unit sphere and the plane $a x + b y + c z = 0$.

- The $[x, y, z]$ are called _Homogeneous Coordinates_.

- Here, the coordinates can be integer numbers, rational numbers (the ratio of two integers), real numbers, complex numbers, or finite field numbers, or even polynomial functions.

---

### Spherical Geometry from 3D vector

![sphere](figs/sphere.png){#fig:sphere}

---

### Example 4: Hyperbolic Geometry from 3D vector

- A velocity "point": projection of a 3D vector $[p] = [x, y, t]$ onto 2D plane $t = 1$: $$(v_x, v_y) = (x/t, y/t)$$

---

### Counterexamples

- In some quorum systems, two "lines" are allowed to meet at more than one point. Therefore, it is a projective geometry only in very special cases.

- In some systems, the line from $A$ to $B$ is not the same as the line from $B$ to $A$, so they cannot form a projective geometry.

- "Symmetry" is an important keyword in projective geometry.

---

### Number systems

- Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$):
  - e.g. $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, -1, -2, -3, \ldots$
  - discrete, more computationally efficient.
- Rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Z}]$):
  - e.g. $0/1, 2/3, -1/3, 1/0$ (i.e. infinity)
  - Multiplication/division is simpler than addition/subtraction
- Real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$):
  - e.g. $0.3$, $2^{1/2}$, $\pi$
  - May induce round-off errors.
- Finite field, $GF(n)$, where $n$ is a prime number (e.g.
  $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$) or prime powers (e.g. $4=2^2, 8=2^3, 9=3^2$).
  - Used in Coding Theory

---

### Number systems (cont'd)

- Complex numbers ($\mathbb{C}$):
  - e.g. $1 + \pi i$, $1 - 3\pi i$
  - Besides the identity (the only automorphism of the real numbers), there is also the automorphism $\tau$ that sends $x + i y$ to $x - iy$ such that $\tau(\tau(x)) = x$.
- Complex numbers over integers ($\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}]$)
  - e.g. $1 + 2 i$, $1 - 2 i$
  - are also known as Gaussian integers.
- Complex numbers over rational numbers ($\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Q}]$)

- Projective Geometry can work on all these number systems.

- In fact, Projective Geometry can work on any field. Moreover, multiplicative inverse operations are not required.

- No "Continuity" is assumed in Projective Geometry.

---

### Example 4: Poker Card Geometry

- Even "coordinates" is **not** necessary for projective geometry.

- Consider the poker cards in @tbl:poker_card:

  - For example, meet($l_2, l_5$) = `5`, join(`J`, `4`) = $l_8$.

- We call this _Poker Card Geometry_ here.

### Finite projective plane

- Yet we may assign the homogeneous coordinate to a finite projective plane where the vector operations are in a finite field.

- E.g. the poker card geometry is a finite projective plane of order 3.

- The smallest finite projective plane (order 2) contains only 7 points and 7 lines.

- If the order is prime or prime powers, then we can easily construct the finite projective plane via finite fields and homogeneous coordinates.

- In 1989, the nonexistence of finite projective plane of order 10 was proved . The proof took the equivalent of 2000 hours on a Cray 1 supercomputer.

- The existence of many other higher order finite projective planes remains an open question.

---

### Not covered in this work

- Unless specifically mentioned, we will not discuss finite projective plane further more.

- Although coordinate systems are not a requirement for general projective geometry, practically all examples we deal with have homogeneous coordinates. The proofs of all theorems are based on the assumption of homogeneous coordinates.

## Basic Properties

---

### Collinear, Concurrent, and Coincidence

- If all three points lie on the same line, they are said to be _collinear_.

- If all three lines intersect at the same point, they are called _concurrent_.

- Denote the coincidence relationship as coI($A,B,C$).

- coI($A,B,C$) is true precisely when $AB \circ C$ is true.

- Similarly, coI($a,b,c$) is true precisely when $ab \circ c$ is true.

- In general, coI($A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$) is true precisely when $A_1 A_2 \circ X$ is true for all $X$ in the remaining points $A_3, A_4, \ldots, A_n$.

- Unless otherwise mentioned, $ABCD\ldots$ is assumed to be coincide, while $\\{ABCD\ldots\\}$ is assumed to coincide with none of the three.

---

### Parameterize a line

- The points on a line $AB$ can be parameterized by $\lambda [A] + \mu [B]$, with $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are not both zero.

- For integer coordinates, to show that $\lambda [A] + \mu [B]$ can span all integer points on the line, we give the exact expression of $\lambda/\mu$ for a point $C$ as follows.

- Let $l = [C] \times ([A] \times [B])$.

- Then
  $$\lambda [A] + \mu [B] = (l^\mathsf{T} [B]) [A] - (l^\mathsf{T} [A]) [B]$$

            return False
    return True

def coI(p, q, *rest):
    assert p != q
    return coI_core(p*q, rest )

def plucker(lambda1, p, mu1, q):
    T = type(p)
    return T(lambda1 * p + mu1 * q)
```

---

### Pappus' Theorem

- Theorem (Pappus): Given two lines $ABC$ and $DEF$. Let $G$=meet($AE,BD$), $H$=meet($AF,CD$), and $I$=meet($BF,CE$). Then $G,H,I$ are collinear.

- Sketch of the _proof_:
  - Let $[C] = \lambda_1 [A] + \mu_1 [B]$.
  - Let $[F] = \lambda_2 [D] + \mu_2 [E]$.
  - Express $[G], [H], [I]$ in terms of $[A], [B], \lambda_1, \mu_1, \lambda_2, \mu_2$.
  - Simplify the expression $[G] \cdot ([H] \times [I])$ and conclude that it is equal to 0 (we may use the Python's symbolic package for the calculation).
- Exercise: verify that this theorem holds for `3`, `6`, `Q` on $l_3$ and `8`, `9`, `J` on $l_8$ in the poker card geometry.

### Triangles and Trilaterals

- If three points $A$, $B$, and $C$ are not collinear, they form a triangle, denoted as $\\{ABC\\}$.

- If three lines $a$, $b$, and $c$ are not concurrent, they form a trilateral, denoted as $\\{abc\\}$.

- Triangle $\\{ABC\\}$ and trilateral $\\{abc\\}$ are dual if $A = bc$, $B = ac$ and $C = ab$.

## Projectivities and Perspectivities

---

### Projectivities

- An ordered set $(A,B,C)$ (whether collinear or not) is called a projective of a concurrent set $abc$ precisely when $A \circ a$, $B \circ b$ and $C \circ c$.

- Denote this as $(A,B,C)$ $\barwedge$ $abc$.

- An ordered set $(a,b,c)$ (whether concurrent or not) is called a projective of a collinear set $ABC$ precisely when $A \circ a$, $B \circ b$ and $C \circ c$.

- Denote this as $(a,b,c)$ $\barwedge$ $ABC$.

- If each ordered set is coincident, we may write:
  - $ABC$ $\barwedge$ $abc$ $\barwedge$ $A'B'C'$
  - Or simply write $ABC$ $\barwedge$ $A'B'C'$

---

### Perspectivities

- An ordered set $(A,B,C)$ is called a perspectivity of an ordered set $(A', B', C')$ precisely when $(A,B,C)$ $\barwedge$ $abc$ and $(A', B', C')$ $\barwedge$ $abc$ for some concurrent set $abc$.

- Denote this as $(A, B, C)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(A', B', C')$.

- An ordered set $(a,b,c)$ is called a perspectivity of an ordered set $(a', b', c')$ precisely when $(a,b,c)$ $\barwedge$ $ABC$ and $(a',b',c')$ $\barwedge$ $ABC$ for some collinear set $ABC$.

- Denote this as $(a,b,c)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(a', b', c')$.

### Another instance of perspectivity

### Perspectivity

- Similar definition for more than three points:
  - $(A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots,A_n)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(A_1',A_2',A_3',\ldots,A_n')$.
- To check perspectivity:
  - First construct a point $O$ := meet($A_1 A_1', A_2 A_2'$).
  - For the rest of the points, check if $X, X', O$ are collinear.
- Note that $(A,B,C)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(D,E,F)$ and $(D,E,F)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(G,H,I)$ does not imply $(A,B,C)$ $\doublebarwedge$ $(G,H,I)$.

    O = (pL * pM) * (qL * qM)

### Desargues's Theorem

- Theorem (Desargues): Let the trilateral $\\{abc\\}$ be the dual of the triangle $\\{ABC\\}$ and the trilateral $\\{a'b'c'\\}$ be the dual of the triangle $\\{A'B'C'\\}$. Then $\\{ABC\\}$ $\doublebarwedge$ $\\{A'B'C'\\}$ if and only if $\\{abc\\}$ $\doublebarwedge$ $\\{a'b'c'\\}$.

- Sketch of the _proof_:
  - Let $O$ be the perspective point.
  - Let $[A'] = \lambda_1 [A] + \mu_1 [O]$.
  - Let $[B'] = \lambda_2 [B] + \mu_2 [O]$.
  - Let $[C'] = \lambda_3 [C] + \mu_3 [O]$.
  - Let $[G]$ = $([A] \times [B]) \times ([A'] \times [B'])$
  - Let $[H]$ = $([B] \times [C]) \times ([B'] \times [C'])$
  - Let $[I]$ = $([A] \times [C]) \times ([A'] \times [C'])$
  - Express $[G], [H], [I]$ in terms of $[A], [B], [C], [O], \lambda_1, \mu_1, \lambda_2, \mu_2, \lambda_3, \mu_3$.
  - Simplify the expression $[G] \cdot ([H] \times [I])$ and find that it is equal to 0. (we may use the Python's symbolic package for the calculation.)
  - Due to the duality, the only-if part can be proved using the same technique.

### Projective Transformation

- Given a function $\tau$ that transforms a point $A$ into another point $\tau(A)$.

- If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear and we always have $\tau(A)$, $\tau(B)$, and $\tau(C)$ collinear. Then the function $\tau$ is called a projective transformation.

- In Homogeneous coordinates, a projective transformation is any non-singular matrix multiplied by a vector.

---

### Quadrangles and Quadrilateral Sets

- Given four points $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $S$, if none of three are collinear, they form a quadrangle, denoted as $\\{PQRS\\}$.

- Note that the quadrangle here can be either convex or self-intersecting.

- In total, there are six lines formed by $\\{PQRS\\}$.

- Suppose they meet another line $l$ at $A, B, C, D, E, F$, where

  - $A$ = meet($PQ, l$), $D$ = meet($RS, l$)

  - $B$ = meet($QR, l$), $E$ = meet($PS, l$)

  - $C$ = meet($PR, l$), $F$ = meet($QS, l$)

- We call these six points a quadrilateral set, denoted as $(AD)(BE)(CF)$.

---

### Quadrilateral set

![quad_set](figs/quad_set.svg){#fig:quad_set}

---

### Another quadrilateral set

![quad_set2](figs/quad_set2.svg){#fig:quad_set2}

---

### Harmonic Sets

- In a quadrilateral set $(AD)(BE)(CF)$, if $A=D$ and $B=E$, then it is called a harmonic set.

- The Harmonic relation is denoted by $H(AB, CF)$.

- Then $C$ and $F$ is called a harmonic conjugate.

- Theorem: If $ABCF$ $\barwedge$ $abcd$, then $H(AB, CF) = H(ab, cf)$.

- In other words, projectivity preserves harmonic relation.

- Theorem: If $ABCF$ $\doublebarwedge$ $A'B'C'F'$, then $H(AB, CF) = H(A'B', C'F')$.

- In other words, perspectivity preserves harmonic relation.

### Basic metric between point and line

- A basic metric between $p$ and $l$, denoted by $p\cdot l$ (inner product):

  - $p \cdot l$ can be positive, negative, and zero.

  - $p \cdot l = 0$ precisely when $p$ lies on $l$.

---

### Cross Ratio

- Given a line incident with $ABCD$. Choose an arbitrary point $O$ that is not on that line.

- The cross ratio is defined as:

  $$R(A, B; C, D) = (OA \cdot C)(OB \cdot D)/(OA \cdot D)(OB \cdot C)$$

- Note: the cross ratio does not depend on what $O$ is chosen.

### 🐍 Python Code (IV)

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import numpy as np

def ratio_ratio(a, b, c, d):
    if isinstance(a, (int, np.int64)):
        return Fraction(a, b) / Fraction(c, d)
    return (a * d) / (b * c)

def x_ratio(A, B, l, m):
    dAl = A.dot(l)
    dAm = A.dot(m)
    dBl = B.dot(l)
    dBm = B.dot(m)
    return ratio_ratio(dAl, dAm, dBl, dBm)

def R(A, B, C, D):
    O = (C*D).aux()
    return x_ratio(A, B, O*C, O*D)
```

### Polarities

- A _polarity_ is a projective correlation of period 2.

- We call $a$ the _polar_ of $A$, and $A$ the pole of $a$.

- Denote $a = A^\perp$ and $A = a^\perp$.

- Except for the degenerate cases, $A = (A^\perp)^\perp$ and $a = (a^\perp)^\perp$.

- It may happen that $A$ is incident with $a$ so that each is _self-conjugate_.

- The locus of self-conjugate points defines a _conic_. However, polarity is a more general concept than conics, because some polarities may have no self-conjugate points (or their self-conjugate points are complex).

---

### The Use of a Self-Polar triangle

- Any projective correlation that relates three vertices of one triangle to their respective opposite sides is a polarity.

- Thus, any triangle $\\{ABC\\}$, any point $P$ not on a side, and any line $p$ not throughout a vertex, determine a definite polarity $(ABC)(Pp)$.

---

### The Conic

- Historically _ellipse_ (including _circle_), _parabola_, and _hyperbola_.

- The locus of self-conjugate points is a _conic_.

- Their polars are its _tangents_.

- Any other line is called a _secant_ or a _nonsecant_ according to whether it meets the conic twice or not at all, i.e., according to whether the involution of conjugate points on it is hyperbolic or elliptic.

- Note: Intersecting a conic with a line may result of an irrational intersection point.

### Construct the polar of a point using a conic

- To construct the polar of a given point $C$, not on the conic, draw any two secants $PQ$ and $RS$ through $C$; then the polar joins the two points meet($QR, PS$) and meet($RP, QS$).

### Construct the pole from a line
