## Introduction

---

### Key points

- Gravity/electromagnetic force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of their distance.

- Distance and angle may be powerful for oriented measures. But quadrance and spread are more energy saving for non-oriented measures.

- Euclidean Geometry is a degenerate case.

---

### Cayley-Klein Geometry

- Projective geometry can further be categorized by a specific polarity.

- Except degenerate cases, $(A^\perp)^\perp = A$ and $(a^\perp)^\perp = a$

- A fundamental cone $\mathcal{F} = (\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B})$ is defined by a pole/polar pair such that $[A^\perp] = \mathbf{A} \cdot [A]$ and $[a^\perp] = \mathbf{B} \cdot [a]$.

- To visualize the Cayley-Klein Geometry, we may project the objects to the 2D plane.

- In hyperbolic geometry, the projection of the fundamental conic to the 2D plane is a unit circle, which is called *null circle*. The distance and angle measures could be negative outside the null circle.

- We may consider Euclidean geometry as a hyperbolic geometry where the null circle is expanded toward the infinity.

- In this section, we use the vector notation $p = [A]$ and $l = [a]$.

### Fundamental Cone with a pole and polar

![Fudanmental Cone with a pole and polar](figs/F.svg){#fig:F}

### Examples

- Let $p = [x, y, z]$ and $l = [a, b, c]$

.pull-left[

- Hyperbolic geometry:
  - $\mathbf{A} \cdot p \equiv [x, y, -z]$
  - $\mathbf{B} \cdot l \equiv [a, b, -c]$

- Elliptic geometry:
  - $\mathbf{A} \cdot p \equiv [x, y, z]$
  - $\mathbf{B} \cdot l \equiv [a, b, c]$

]
.pull-right[

- Euclidean geometry (degenerate conic):
  - $\mathbf{A} \cdot p \equiv [0, 0, z]$
  - $\mathbf{B} \cdot l \equiv [a, b, 0]$

- psuedo-Euclidean geometry (degenerate conic):
  - $\mathbf{A} \cdot p \equiv [0, 0, z]$
  - $\mathbf{B} \cdot l \equiv [a, -b, 0]$

]

---

### Examples (cont'd)

- Perspective view of Euclidean geometry (degenerate conic):
  - Let $l$ be the line of infinity.
  - Let $p$ and $q$ are two points on $l$. Then
  - $\mathbf{A} \equiv l \cdot l^{T}$ (outer product)
  - $\mathbf{B} \equiv p \cdot q^{T} + q \cdot p^{T}$

---

### Orthogonality

- A line $l$ is said to be perpendicular to line $m$ if $l^\perp$ lies on $m$, i.e., $m^T \mathbf{B} l = 0$.

- To find a perpendicular line of $l$ that passes through $p$, join $p$ to the pole of $l$, i.e., join($p, l^\perp$). We call this the *altitude* line of $l$.

- For duality, a point $p$ is said to be perpendicular to point $q$ if $q^T \mathbf{A} p = 0$.

- The altitude point can be defined similarly.

- Note that Euclidean geometry does not have the concept of the perpendicular point because every $p^\perp$ is the line of infinity.

---

### Orthocenter of triangle

- Theorem 1 (Orthocenter and ortholine). The altitude lines of a non-dual triangle meet at a unique point $O$, called the *orthocenter* of the triangle.

- Although there is "center" in the name, orthocenter could be outside a triangle.

- Theorem 2. If the orthocenter of triangle $\{ABC\}$ is $O$, then the orthocenter of triangle $\{OBC\}$ is $A$.

### Involution

- Involutions are closely related to geometric reflections.

- The defining property of an involution $\tau$ is that $\tau(\tau(p)) = p$ for every point $p$.

- Theorem: Let $\tau$ be an involution. Then
    1. there is a line $m$ with $\tau(p) = p$ for every poiny $p$ incident with $m$.
    2. there is a point $o$ with $\tau(l) = l$ for every line $l$ incident with $o$.

- We call the line $m$ a *mirror* and the point $o$ the *center* of the involution.

- If $o$ is at the line of infinity (Euclidean Geometry), then we get an undistorted Euclidean line reflection in $m$.

- If we choose $o = m^\perp$, then we keep the fundamental cone invariant.

---

### Involution (cont'd)

- Theorem: The point transformation matrix $T$ of a projective involution $\tau$ with center $o$ and mirror $m$ is given by
  $$ (o^T m) \mathrm{I} - 2 o m^T$$

- In other words, $T\cdot p$ = $(o^T m) p - 2 (m^T p) o$.

## Basic measurement

---

### Basic measure between point and line

- A basic measure between $p$ and $l$, denoted by $p^T l$ (inner product):

  - $p^T l$ can be positive, negative, and zero.

  - $p^T l = 0$ if and only if $p$ lies on $l$.

---

### Cross Ratio

- Given a line incident with $ABCD$. Arbitrary choose a point $O$ not on the line.

- The cross ratio is defined as:

  $$R(A, B; C, D) = (OA \cdot C)(OB \cdot D)/(OA \cdot D)(OB \cdot C)$$

---

### Quadrance and Spread for general cases

- Let $\Phi(x) = x \cdot x^\perp$.

- $\Phi(A) = A \cdot A^\perp = [A]^T \mathbf{A} [A]$.

- $\Phi(a) = a \cdot a^\perp = [a]^T \mathbf{B} [a]$.

- The **quadrance** $q(A, B)$ between points $A$ and $B$  is:
  $$q(A, B) \equiv  \Phi(AB) / \Phi(A) \Phi(B)$$

- The **spread** $s(l ,m )$ between lines $l$ and $m$  is
  $$s(l, m) \equiv  \Phi(lm) / \Phi(l) \Phi(m)$$

- Note: they are invariant of any projective transformations.

---

### Relation with Traditional Distance and Angle

- Hyperbolic:
  - $q(A, B ) = \sinh^2(d(A, B))$
  - $s(l, m ) = \sin^2(\theta(l, m))$

- Elliptic:
  - $q(A, B ) = \sin^2(d(A, B))$
  - $s(l, m ) = \sin^2(\theta(l, m))$

- Euclidean:
  - $q(A, B ) = d^2(A, B)$
  - $s(l, m ) = \sin^2(\theta(l, m))$

---

### Spread law and Thales Theorem

- Spread Law
  $$q_1/s_1 = q_2/s_2 = q_3/s_3.$$

- (Compare with the sine law in Euclidean Geometry):
  $$d_1/\sin \theta_1 = d_2/\sin \theta_2 = d_3/\sin \theta_3.$$

- Theorem (Thales): Suppose that $\{a_1 a_2 a_3\}$ is a right triangle with $s_3 = 1$. Then
    $$s_1 = q_1 / q_3 \quad \text{and} \quad s_2 = q_2 / q_3$$

- Note: in some geometries, two lines are perpendicular does not imply they have a right angle ($s = 1$).

---

### Triangle proportions

- Theorem (Triangle proportions): Suppose that $d$ is a point lying on the line $a_1 a_2$. Define the quadrances $r_1 \equiv q(a_1, d)$ and $r_1 \equiv q(a_2, d)$, and the spreads $R_1 \equiv s(a_3 a_1, a_3 d)$ and $R_2 \equiv s(a_3 a_2, a_3 d)$. Then
  $$R_1/R_2 = (s_1/s_2)(r_1/r_2) = (q_1/q_2)(r_1/r_2).$$

---

### Midpoint and Angle Bisector

- There are two angle bisectors for two lines.
- There are two midpoints for two points also in general geometries.
- Let $r$ be the midpint of $p$ and $q$.
- Then $r$ = $\sqrt{\Phi(p)} q \pm \sqrt{\Phi(q)} p$.
- Let $b$ be the angle bisector of $l$ and $m$.
- Then $b$ = $\sqrt{\Phi(m)} l \pm \sqrt{\Phi(l)} m$.
- Note:
    - The midpoint could be irrational in general.
    - The midpoint could even be complex, even the two points are real.
    - Two angle bisectors are perpendicular.
    - In Euclidean geometry, another midpoint is at the line of infinity.

---

### Constructing midpoints using the fundamental conic

???

---

### Midpoint in Euclidean geometry

- Let $l$ be the line of infinity.
- $\mathbf{A} \equiv l \cdot l^{T}$
- $\Phi(p)$ = $p^T \mathbf{A} p$ = $(p^T l)^2$.
- Then, the midpoint $r$ = $(q^T l) p \pm (p^T l) q$.
- One midpoint $(q^T l) p - (p^T l) q$ in fact lies on $l$.

---

### Constructing angle bisectors using a conic

1. For each line construct the two tangents $(t_f^1, t_f^2)$ and $(t_g^1, t_g^2)$ of its intersection points with the fundamental conic to that conic.
2. The following lines are the two angle bisectors:
   - join(meet($t_f^1, t_g^1$), meet($t_f^2, t_g^2$))
   - join(meet($t_f^1, t_g^2$), meet($t_f^2, t_g^1$))

> Remark: the tangents in elliptic geometry have complex coordinates. However, the angle bisectors are real objects again.

### Constructing a pair of angle bisectors

### Angle Bisector Theorem

- Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be three lines such that none of them tangents to the fundamental conic.

- Then one set of angle bisector $m^1_{ab}, m^1_{bc}, m^1_{ac}$ are concurrent.

- Furthermore, the points meet($m^2_{ab}, c$_), meet($m^2_{bc}, a$_), meet($m^2_{ac}, b$_) are collinear.

### Midpoint theorem

- Let $p$, $q$, $r$ be three points such that none of them lies on the fundamental conic.

- Then one set of midpoints $m^1_{pq}$_, $m^1_{qr}$_, $m^1_{pr}$_ are collinear.

- Furthermore, the lines join($m^2_{pq}, r$_), join($m^2_{qr}, p$_), join($m^2_{pr}, q$_) meet at a point.
