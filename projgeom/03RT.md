## 👋 Introduction

### 🔑 Key Points

In Hyperbolic Geometry, two parallel lines meet outside the null circle. ⭕

Given a line $l$, there are more than one parallel lines that pass through a point $p$.

Notations: To distinguish with Euclidean geometry, lines are written as capital letters.

### 📏 Quadrance and Spread in Hyperbolic/Elliptic Geometry

✨ For efficiency, quadrance and spread can also be written as follows.

📏 The **quadrance** $q(a, b)$ between points $a$ and $b$ is:
$$q(a, b) \equiv 1 - (a \cdot b^\perp)^2 / (a \cdot a^\perp)(b \cdot b^\perp)$$

📐 The **spread** $S(L, M)$ between lines $L$ and $M$ is
$$S(L, M ) \equiv 1 - (L \cdot M^\perp)^2 / (L \cdot L^\perp)(M \cdot M^\perp)$$

⚠️ Note: In Hyperbolic Geometry, the quadrance of two points inside the null circle is negative.

### ↔️ Relation with Traditional Distance and Angle

📏 Hyperbolic Distance: $$q(a, b ) = \sinh^2(d(a, b ) )$$

📐 Hyperbolic Angle: $$S(L, M ) = \sin^2(\theta(L, M))$$

📏 Elliptic Distance: $$q(a, b ) = \sin^2(d(a, b ))$$

📐 Elliptic Angle: $$S(L, M ) = \sin^2(\theta(L, M))$$

### 📐 Spread Law

⚖️ Spread Law $$\color{Green}{q_1/S_1 = q_2/S_2 = q_3/S_3}.$$

📐 (Compare with the sine law in traditional Hyperbolic Geometry):
$$\color{red}{\sinh d_1/\sin \theta_1 = \sinh d_2/\sin \theta_2 = \sinh d_3/\sin \theta_3}.$$

📐 (Compare with the sine law in traditional Elliptic Geometry):
$$\color{red}{\sin d_1/\sin \theta_1 = \sin d_2/\sin \theta_2 = \sin d_3/\sin \theta_3}.$$

### 🔢 Triple Formulae

🧮 Theorem (Triple quad formula): If $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ are collinear points then
$$(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)^2 = 2(q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2) + 4 q_1 q_2 q_3$$

🧮 Theorem (Triple spread formula): If $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_3$ are concurrent lines then
$$(S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = 2(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2) + 4 S_1 S_2 S_3.$$

---

### ✖️ Cross Law

✖️ Theorem (Cross law)
$$(S_1 S_2 q_3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3) + 2)^2 = 4(1 - S_1)(1 - S_2)(1 - S_3).$$

✖️ Theorem (Cross dual law)
$$(q_1 q_2 S_3 - (q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + 2)^2 = 4(1 - q_1)(1 - q_2)(1 - q_3).$$

🔄 Note: Given three quadrances, three spreads can be uniquely determined. Same as Euclidean Geometry.

⚠️ Note: Given three spreads, three quadrances can be uniquely determined. Not true in Euclidean Geometry.

### 📐 Right Triangles and Pythagoras

📏 Theorem (Pythagoras): If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are perpendicular lines ($S(L_1, L_2) = 1$) then $$q_3 = q_1 + q_2 - q_1 q_2.$$

📐 Theorem (Thales): Suppose that $\\{a_1 a_2 a_3\\}$ is a right triangle with $S_3 = 1$. Then $S_1 = q_1 / q_3$ and $S_2 = q_2 / q_3$.

---

### ➡️ Right Parallax

📐 Theorem (Right parallax): If a right triangle $\\{a_1 a_2 a_3\\}$ has spreads $S_1 = 0$, $S_2 = S$ and $S_3 = 1$, then it will have only one defined quadrance $q_1 = q$ given by $$q = (S - 1)/S.$$

🔄 We may restate this result in the form: $$S = 1 / (1 - q).$$

### 🔺 Triangle Proportions

⚖️ Theorem (Triangle proportions): Suppose that $d$ is a point lying on the line $a_1 a_2$. Define the quadrances $r_1 \equiv q(a_1, d)$ and $r_1 \equiv q(a_2, d)$, and the spreads $R_1 \equiv S(a_3 a_1, a_3 d)$ and $R_2 \equiv S(a_3 a_2, a_3 d)$. Then $$R_1/R_2 = (S_1/S_2)(r_1/r_2) = (q_1/q_2)(r_1/r_2).$$
