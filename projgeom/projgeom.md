## Introduction

**What is `projgeom`?** ✨🤔💡

- A Python package for performing **geometric calculations** 📐🧮
- Specifically designed for working with **projective geometry** and its related geometries like **Cayley-Klein** 🏛️, **Elliptic** 🔵, **Hyperbolic** 🔴, and **Perspective** geometry 🖼️
- Provides tools for representing geometric objects like **points** ⚫ and **lines** ➖
- Achieves its purpose through a series of **mathematical operations** ➗✖️ and **geometric algorithms** 🤖
- Uses **abstract methods** 🧩 and **type hinting** ✍️ to define the structure of classes and their properties
- Follows an **object-oriented programming** approach 🧱 to represent geometric entities and their relations

## Core Concepts

**Key Ideas** 🔑🧠💭

- **Projective Geometry:** The fundamental space where objects like points and lines exist 🌌. The package provides a framework for this 🏗️
- **Geometric Objects:** Points ⚫ and lines ➖ are the primary objects, often represented by coordinates
- **Duality:** A core principle allowing interchangeability between points and lines 🔄. Many objects have a `dual()` method 🔀
- **Perpendicularity (Polar/Pole):** The concept of perpendicularity is implemented, often via a `perp()` method, which returns the pole or polar of an object ⏹️
- **Incidence:** Checking if a point lies on a line or vice versa ✔️. Represented by the `incident()` method 🔍
- **Meet/Join:** Finding the intersection of two objects (meet) or the line connecting two points (join) ✖️. Represented by the `meet()` method 🤝

## Modules - Overview

**Package Structure** 📁🗂️📚

The package is organized into several modules, each focusing on specific geometries or object types:

- `projgeom.hyp_object` - Hyperbolic geometry objects 🔴🌀
- `projgeom.myck_object` - Custom Cayley-Klein points and lines 🌟🎨
- `projgeom.persp_object` - Perspective geometry points and lines 🖼️👁️

## `projgeom.pg_plane` Module

**Projective Plane Functions** 🌐🧮

- Defines a `ProjectivePlane` class and several functions related to projective geometry.
- Provides a **framework** for working with points and lines in a projective plane. 🛠️
- The `ProjectivePlane` is an abstract base class defining **basic operations** and **properties**.

- `coincident()`: Checks if **three points are collinear** (lie on the same line). 📏
- `check_pappus()`: Implements **Pappus's hexagon theorem**. ⬡
- `tri_dual()`: Computes the **dual of a triangle** (the lines formed by its sides). 🔺
- `persp()`: Checks if **two triangles are in perspective** (their corresponding sides intersect at collinear points). 👁️
- `check_desargue()`: Implements **Desargues's theorem**. 🏛️
- `harm_conj()`: Calculates the **harmonic conjugate of three collinear points**. 🎼

## Design Philosophy

**Under the Hood** 💡⚙️

- **Abstract Methods & Type Hinting:** Used extensively to define clear interfaces and improve code readability and maintainability. 📝
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Geometric objects are instances of classes with methods for operations. 🏗️
- **Comprehensive Toolset:** Aims to be a powerful toolkit for creating and manipulating geometric objects easily. 🧰
- **Mathematical Principles:** Built upon the consistent mathematical principles of projective spaces. ➗
- **Logical Flow:** Basic operations like checking incidence or finding intersections are used to support higher-level geometric calculations and theorems. 🔄

---

## Examples

**Putting it to Use** 🧪🔧

- Examples are provided within the documentation for many functions and methods.
- Demonstrate importing objects and functions:

  ```python
  >>> from projgeom.hyp_object import HyperbolicLine, HyperbolicPoint
  >>> t = altitude(HyperbolicPoint(), HyperbolicLine())
  ```

  ```python
  >>> from projgeom.pg_object import PgPoint, PgLine
  >>> pt_p = PgObject()
  >>> ln_l = PgObject()
  >>> pt_p.incident(ln_l)
  False
  ```

- Examples show how to create objects, perform operations like `incident()`, `dot()`, `cross()`, `check_desargue`, etc., and interpret the results.
