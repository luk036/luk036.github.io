## Overview 🌍

In 2005, Norman Wildberger introduced a concept for geometry without transcendental functions in his book *"Divine Proportions"*. Inspired by ancient mathematics, he uses spreads and quadrances instead of angles and lengths to describe geometric relationships.

This approach allows most tasks and proofs of Euclidean geometry to be carried out without sine and cosine functions, offering clear didactic advantages.

## Key Concepts of Rational Trigonometry 🔑

- **Quadrance** 📏

  The squared area over a distance, replacing the concept of length.

- **Spread** 📐

  The squared ratio of the opposite to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, replacing angles.

- **Rational Numbers** ➗

  All calculations use only rational numbers, avoiding transcendental functions.

## Advantages of Rational Trigonometry ✅

- **Simplicity** ✨

  Easier to understand and apply, especially for students new to trigonometry.

- **Accuracy** 🎯

  As accurate as traditional engineering mathematics for practical applications.

- **Logical Consistency** 🔗

  Avoids problems associated with infinite objects and transcendental functions.

## Five Laws of Rational Trigonometry ⚖️

- **Pythagoras' Theorem (PT)** 🔺

  Relates quadrances in a right-angled triangle.

- **Triple Quad Formula (TQF)** 3️⃣📏

  Describes relationships between quadrances in any triangle.

- **Cross Law (CL)** ✖️

  Replaces the cosine law in traditional trigonometry.

- **Spread Law (SL)** ↔️

  Analogous to the sine law in traditional trigonometry.

- **Triple Spread Formula (TSF)** 3️⃣📐

  Replaces the sum of angles rule for triangles.

## Practical Application: Measuring a Lighthouse 🗼

1. **Measure** 📏

   Take spreads *s₁, s₂* and quadrance *Q₃* from two standpoints.

2. **Calculate** 🧮

   Use Triple Spread Formula and Spread Law to find quadrance *H*.

3. **Result**

   Determine height *h* by taking the square root of *H*.

## Comparison: Rational vs Traditional Method ⚖️

- **Rational Method** ➗

  Uses spreads and quadrances directly in calculations. Avoids trigonometric functions. Results in quadrance *H = 201.4906705* and height *h ≈ 14.22777860*.

- **Traditional Method** 📐

  Converts spreads to angles and quadrances to distances. Uses sine law and trigonometric functions. Results in a similar height value with slight differences due to decimal cancellation.

## Educational Implications 🎓

1. **Foundation** 🏗️

   Rational trigonometry as a base for geometric understanding.

2. **Intermediate** ↔️

   Application in problem-solving without transcendental functions.

3. **Advanced** 🚀

   Bridge to more complex mathematical concepts.

This approach could be useful as a didactic and methodological concept in schools and universities, providing a solid foundation before introducing differential calculus.
