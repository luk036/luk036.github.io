## Credit 🙏

- **Title:** Bayesian Optimization: Theory and Practice Using Python 🐍
- **Based on:** Excerpts from the book by Peng Liu 📖
- **Subtitle:** A Sample-Efficient Approach to Global Optimization 🎯

---

## What is Bayesian Optimization (BO)?

- A **class of methodology** for sample-efficient global optimization. 🔄
- Seeks the **optimal solution as fast as possible** ⚡.
- Aims to find the global maximum (or minimum) of an unknown **black-box function** 📦.
- Provides a **unified framework** for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. 🧩
- Involves iteratively probing the unknown function to guide the search. 🔍

---

## Why Use Bayesian Optimization?

- **Sample Efficiency:** Finds optimal solutions with significantly fewer function evaluations compared to methods like grid search or random search.
- **Handles Black-Box Functions:** Effective when the objective function is expensive to evaluate, lacks derivatives, or its structure is unknown. 🤖
- **Quantifies Uncertainty:** Provides probabilistic estimates of the objective function, crucial for guiding the search. 🎲
- **Sequential Decision Making:** Builds upon Bayesian Decision Theory principles. ⚖️
- Applicable to various problems, like hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. 🤖🔧

---

## Core Components of BO

- **Surrogate Model:** Approximates the unknown objective function. 🏗️
  - Provides mean prediction and uncertainty estimates.
  - **Gaussian Processes (GP)** are a powerful and common choice. 🌟
- **Acquisition Function:** A utility function that guides the sequential search. 🧭
  - Decides the **next best location to sample** 📍.
  - Balances **exploration** (sampling where uncertainty is high) 🗺️ and **exploitation** (sampling near current best values) 💎.
  - Examples: Expected Improvement (EI), Knowledge Gradient (KG). 📈

---

## Quick Detour: Bayesian Statistics Basics for BO

- **Bayesian Inference:** Updating prior beliefs with observed data to obtain a **posterior distribution**. 🔄
  - Prior + Likelihood → Posterior. ➕➡️📊
  - Posterior distribution reflects belief _after_ seeing data. Approaches normal distribution with more data.
- **Prior and Posterior Predictive Distributions:** Distributions for _new_ observations. 🔮
  - Prior Predictive: Expected distribution of new data based on prior belief. 🔮
  - Posterior Predictive: Expected distribution of new data based on updated (posterior) belief. Crucial for reasoning about sampling choices. 🎯

---

## The Bayesian Optimization Workflow

- An iterative process. 🔄
- **Starts with:** Initial dataset (can be small, sometimes generated randomly or with space-filling designs like Sobol sequences). 🎲
- \*\*Main Loop:
  1.  **Update Surrogate Model:** Fit or update the GP model based on all collected data. 🔄
  2.  **Optimize Acquisition Function:** Find the location(s) that maximize the acquisition function. This proposes the next sampling point(s). 📍
  3.  **Probe Environment:** Evaluate the true black-box function at the proposed location(s). 🔍
  4.  **Augment Dataset:** Add the new observation(s) to the dataset. ➕
- Repeats until budget exhausted (e.g., number of iterations). ⏳

---

## Component 1: The Surrogate Model - Gaussian Processes (GP)

- Models the objective function as a **sample from a distribution of functions**. 🎲
- A **nonparametric model** with high expressive capacity.
- Naturally quantifies **uncertainty**. ❓
- Defined by a **mean function** and a **covariance (kernel) function**.
- The **kernel function** encodes prior assumptions about the function (e.g., smoothness). 🌀
  - Examples: Squared Exponential (RBF), Matern, Linear, Periodic. 🔄

---

## GP Theory: Mean & Covariance

- A Gaussian process is an infinite collection of random variables, where any finite subset follows a **multivariate Gaussian distribution**.
- The mean function specifies the expected value of the function at each point. 📍
- The covariance (kernel) function `k(x_i, x_j)` defines the covariance between function values at any two points `x_i` and `x_j`. ↔️
  - It measures their similarity based on distance in the input space. Larger distance usually means smaller covariance/similarity. 📏

---

## GP Prior and Posterior

- **GP Prior:** Represents initial belief about the function before seeing data. Defined by the chosen mean and kernel functions. Can sample functions from this prior. 🎲
- **GP Posterior:** The updated belief after observing data. 🔄
  - Conditioned on observed data points. 📌
  - Provides a posterior mean function (often passing through or near observed points) and a posterior covariance function (uncertainty is reduced near observed points).
  - Uncertainty is typically visualized with **credible intervals** (e.g., 95%).

---

## GP in Practice: Implementing with GPyTorch

- **GPyTorch:** A state-of-the-art GP library built on **PyTorch**. 🏗️
- Leverages PyTorch features: **GPU acceleration** 🚀 and **auto-differentiation** (`autograd`). 🔄
- Allows for efficient **exact or approximate GP inference**.
- Serves as the **backbone for BoTorch**. 🦴

---

## GPyTorch: Model Building & Inference

- Building a GP model involves defining mean, kernel functions, and a likelihood. 🏗️
  - Classes like `gpytorch.means.ConstantMean()` and `gpytorch.kernels.RBFKernel()`. 🛠️
  - Likelihood (`gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood()`) models observation noise. 🔊
- An `ExactGP` model can be defined by inheriting from `gpytorch.models.ExactGP`. 🧬
- Fitting the model (`train` mode) and making predictions (`eval` mode). 🔄
- Obtain mean, lower, and upper confidence bounds for plotting.

---

## GPyTorch: Kernels & Hyperparameter Optimization

- Different kernel functions capture different function properties (smoothness, periodicity, etc.). 🌀
- Kernels can be **combined** via addition and multiplication for more complex functions. ➕✖️
- Kernel and noise parameters (hyperparameters) are crucial for a good fit. 🔧
- These can be optimized by maximizing the **marginal log likelihood (MLL)** of the observed data. 📈
- GPyTorch and BoTorch provide utilities (`ExactMarginalLogLikelihood`, `fit_gpytorch_model`) to automate this optimization using PyTorch's `autograd`. 🤖

---

## Component 2: The Acquisition Function (AF)

- Calculates the **utility** of sampling at a particular location `x`. 💰
- Higher AF value suggests a more promising location. 📈
- Balancing Exploration vs. Exploitation:
  - **Exploration:** Sample in areas with high uncertainty (large credible interval). 🗺️
  - **Exploitation:** Sample near current best observed value. 💎
- Maximizing the AF determines the **next sampling point**. This is the "inner loop" optimization. 🔄
- Policies can be myopic (one-step lookahead) or nonmyopic (multi-step lookahead). 👁️

---

## Acquisition Function: Expected Improvement (EI)

---

## Monte Carlo (MC) Acquisition Functions

- Used when acquisition function expectation **lacks a closed-form solution**. ❌
- Approximates the expectation operator (an integral) via **Monte Carlo simulation**. 🎲
- Draws samples from the GP posterior predictive distribution and averages a function of these samples.
- Example: **Monte Carlo Expected Improvement (MC EI)** or `qExpectedImprovement` in BoTorch. 📈
