### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

- Welcome! Today, we'll explore **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. 👋
- RL is fundamentally different from **supervised learning**. 🔄
- In supervised learning, agents learn a mapping from inputs to outputs using _provided training data_ with known input and output values. A "teacher" or database defines the desired mapping. 🎓
- In RL, the situation is more difficult because **no such training data is available**. ❌📊

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

- The agent learns through **trial and error (or success)** which actions are good in a certain situation. 🔄🎯
- It learns through **reinforcement**. 💪
- Successful attempts are **rewarded**. 🏆
- Unsuccessful attempts are **penalized**. ❌
- This is similar to how humans learn, e.g., a child learning to walk or learning in sports. 👶🚶‍♂️⚽
- Positive and negative reinforcement are key factors. ➕➖

### RL vs. Supervised Learning Summary

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Mapping inputs to outputs. ↔️
  - Requires _complete training data_ (input + desired output). 📂
  - Goal: Approximate the mapping and generalize. 🎯
- **Reinforcement Learning:**
  - Finding good actions in a situation. 🕵️‍♂️
  - _No training data_ is initially available. ❌📊
  - Learns through _interaction_ and _feedback_ (rewards/penalties). 🔄💬
  - Goal: Learn a **policy** that maximizes long-term reward. 🏆📈

### A Robotics Example 🤖🚶‍♂️

- An illustrative example comes from robotics.
- Consider a robot with a rectangular block body and an arm with two joints (gy and gx).
- Actions are discrete movements of the joints (e.g., up/down for gy, right/left for gx). ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️
- The task is to learn a **policy** to move **as quickly as possible to the right**. 🚀➡️
- This robot works analogously to a walking robot in the same two-dimensional state space.
- Movements to the right are **rewarded** positively, movements to the left are **punished** negatively. ➕➖

<div class="mermaid">

    [*] --> State1
    State1 --> State2: Right (+1)
    State1 --> State3: Left (-1)
    State2 --> State4: Right (+1)
    State2 --> State1: Left (-1)
    State3 --> State1: Right (+1)
    State3 --> State5: Left (-1)
    style State1 fill:#f9f
    style State2 fill:#9f9
    style State3 fill:#f99
</div>

---

### Modeling the Task Mathematically 📐

- The robot's **state** is described by the position of its two joints, (gx, gy). Each joint has a finite number of discrete values. 🔢
- The state is encoded as a vector (gx, gy).
- The number of possible positions for gx is nx, and for gy is ny.
- The **evaluation** of actions is based on the robot's horizontal ↔️ position. Positive changes to x (movement right) are rewarded, negative changes (movement left) are penalized. ➕➖
- Figure 10.3 shows state spaces for 2x2 and 4x4 joint positions.

### Agent and Environment 🌍

- We distinguish between the **agent** and its **environment**. 🤖🌿
- At time t, the world (agent + environment) is in a **state** st ∈ S. ⏱️
- S is an abstraction; the agent may have incomplete information due to measurement errors.
- The agent performs an **action** at ∈ A at time t. ⚡
- This action changes the world, resulting in state st+1 at time t+1. 🔄
- The state transition is determined by the environment's function δ: st+1 = δ(st, at). This is outside the agent's influence. 🌐

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Environment
    Agent->>Environment: Action a_t
    Environment->>Agent: Reward r_t
    Environment->>Agent: New State s_t+1
    Note right of Environment: δ(s_t, a_t) = s_t+1
</div>

---

### Reward and Policy ⭐🗺️

- After executing action at, the agent receives an **immediate reward** rt = r(st, at). 💰
- The immediate reward depends on the current state st and executed action at.
- rt > 0 means positive reinforcement; rt < 0 means negative reinforcement for action at in state st. rt = 0 means no immediate feedback. ➕➖🚫
- A **policy π : S → A** is a mapping from states to actions. It tells the agent what action to take in each state. 🗺️
- The **goal of RL** is for the agent to learn an **optimal policy** based on its experiences. 🏆

<div class="mermaid">

    S1 -->|"π(S1)=A2"| A2[Action 2]

    S2 -->|"π(S2)=A3"| A3[Action 3]
    style S1 fill:#f9f
    style S2 fill:#bbf
</div>

---

### Maximizing Reward (Value Function) 📈

- An optimal policy maximizes reward **in the long run**, over many steps. ⏳
- We define the **value** or **discounted reward** V π(st) of a policy π starting in state st:
  - V π(st) = rt + γrt+1 + γ²rt+2 + ... = ∑ γ^i \* rt+i
  - Here, **0 ≤ γ < 1** is a discount factor.
  - **γ** ensures future rewards are discounted; immediate reward is weighted strongest. ⚖️
- An alternative is the **average reward** (though discounted is more common).

<div class="mermaid">
pie
    title Reward Discounting (γ = 0.9)
    "Immediate Reward (r_t)" : 100
    "Next Step (γr_t+1)" : 90
    "Two Steps (γ²r_t+2)" : 81
    "Three Steps (γ³r_t+3)" : 73
</div>

---

### Optimal Policy and Markov Decision Processes (MDP) ✨

- A policy π is **optimal** if V π(s) ≥ V π(s) for all states s. It's at least as good as all other policies. 🏆
- The optimal value function is denoted V.
- The agents discussed typically use only information about the **current state st** to determine the next action, not prior history. ⏱️
- This is justified if reward depends only on the current state and action.
- Processes with this property are called **Markov decision processes (MDP)**. 🔄
- If the agent's actual state is not exactly known (e.g., due to noisy sensors), it's a **partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)**. ❓

<div class="mermaid">

### Solving RL: Combinatorial Search? 🤔

- The simplest approach to finding a successful policy is **combinatorial enumeration of all policies**. 🔍
- However, even in the simple robot example (Example 10.1), there are **very many policies**.
- The number of policies grows **exponentially** with the number of states if there's more than one possible action per state. 📈
- This makes combinatorial search associated with **extremely high computational cost** and impractical for practical applications. ⏳💻
- Heuristic search is also difficult because immediate reward is often zero and cannot serve as a heuristic. ❌

### Solving RL: Value Iteration (Dynamic Programming) 🧠

- The naive approach performs redundant work; many policies are similar. 🔄
- This suggests saving intermediate results for parts of policies and reusing them. 💾
- This is the approach of **dynamic programming**, introduced by Richard Bellman.
- Bellman's principle: For an optimal policy, **all subsequent decisions must be optimal**, independent of the starting state and first action. 🏆
- This principle allows finding a globally optimal policy through **local optimization** of individual actions. �

### The Bellman Equation for V 📜

- We want an optimal policy π that satisfies the optimal value definition.
- This leads to a recursive characterization of the optimal value function V:
  - **V(s) = max_a [r(s, a) + γV(δ(s, a))]**
- This is the **Bellman equation**.
- It means that to calculate V(s), you add the immediate reward r(s, a) to the discounted optimal value of the successor state V(δ(s, a)) for the _best possible action_ 'a' in state 's'. ➕💰

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR

    A -->|a1| R1[Reward + γV(s1)]
    A -->|a2| R2[Reward + γV(s2)]
    A -->|a3| R3[Reward + γV(s3)]
    style S fill:#f9f
    style A fill:#bbf
</div>

---

### Value Iteration Algorithm ⚙️

- The Bellman equation (10.6) leads to an iteration rule for approximating V:
  - **V̂(s) = max_a [r(s, a) + γV̂(δ(s, a))]**
- **Algorithm:**
  1.  Initialize approximate values V̂(s) for all states (e.g., to zero). 🏁
  2.  Repeatedly update V̂(s) for each state using the iteration rule, relying on the V̂ values of successor states. 🔄
- This process is called **value iteration**.
- Value iteration **converges to V**. ✅
- Figure 10.7 shows the schematic algorithm.

### Value Iteration Example ✨

- Figure 10.8 shows value iteration applied to the robot example with γ = 0.9 and 3x3 states.
- The sequence shows the progression of learning. 📈
- The agent explores states, performs value iteration, and saves the policy via a tabulated V function.
- To find the optimal action π(s) from V, you use:
  - **π(s) = argmax_a [r(s, a) + γV(δ(s, a))]**
  - You **must** add the immediate reward r(s, a), not just choose the action leading to the state with maximum V value. 💰
- Value iteration requires a **model of the environment** (knowing r and δ functions). 🌐

### Robot Simulation & Real Robots 🤖🖥️

- Simulators can be used to experiment with reinforcement learning.
- A walking robot simulator allows observing learning, manually supplying feedback, and setting parameters. 🎮
- Real crawling robots were also developed for teaching.
- Learning can happen in simulation (faster) and then be transferred to the robot, or the robot can learn autonomously. 🔄
- A 5x5 state space takes about 30s to learn autonomously on the real robot. ⏱️
- **Differences exist between simulation and real robots**.
- Real robots perceive subtle environmental effects (like grip on surface) through sensors, leading to different, often more efficient, learned policies. 🌍
- Real robots can show **adaptivity**, learning despite defects or changing environments. 🔧

### Q-Learning: Model-Free RL 🌱

- What if the agent **doesn't have a model** of the world (doesn't know r and δ)? ❓
- This is common in robotics; a robot might not know the exact outcome of an action.
- We need to evaluate an action _without_ knowing the successor state.
- We use an evaluation function **Q(s, a)** for state-action pairs.
- The optimal action in state 's' is chosen by **π(s) = argmax_a Q(s, a)** for an optimal function Q. 🏆

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    S[State] -->|a1| Q1[Q(s,a1)]

### The Q-Function and Bellman Equation for Q 🧮

- Similar to V, the value of action 'a' in state 's' is defined using discounted future rewards:
  - **Q(st, at) = r(st, at) + γrt+1 + γ²rt+2 + ...**
- The optimal Q function, Q, is defined recursively:
  - **Q(s, a) = r(s, a) + γ max_a′ Q(δ(s, a), a′)**
- This looks similar to the Bellman equation for V, but the key advantage is that Q directly evaluates state-action pairs.
- Knowing Q allows the agent to choose actions **without a model** of δ and r, simply by picking the action with the highest Q value in the current state. 🏆

### Q-Learning Algorithm 🔄

- An iterative algorithm for determining Q(s, a) is derived from its recursive form.
- **Q̂(s, a) = r(s, a) + γ max_a′ Q̂(δ(s, a), a′)**
- **Algorithm:**
  1.  Initialize a table Q̂(s, a) for all state-action pairs (e.g., with zeroes). 🏁
  2.  Let the agent execute action 'a' in state 's' in the environment.
  3.  Observe the successor state s' = δ(s, a) and the immediate reward r(s, a) from the environment. 👀
  4.  Update Q̂(s, a) using the observed r and the _current_ Q̂ value of the best action in the successor state s'. 🔄
- Figure 10.11 shows the schematic algorithm.

### Q-Learning Convergence (Deterministic) ✅

- Theorem 10.1 states that for a **deterministic MDP** with bounded reward and 0 ≤ γ < 1, Q̂n(s, a) **converges to Q(s, a)** for all s and a as n → ∞.
- This convergence is guaranteed **if each state-action pair is visited infinitely often**. 🔄
- The proof shows that the maximum error in the Q̂ table is reduced by at least the factor γ in intervals where all state-action transitions occur at least once.
- Thus, the error converges to zero.
- Convergence is independent of the specific actions chosen _during learning_, as long as they are all visited infinitely often. The _speed_ of convergence _does_ depend on the paths taken. ⏱️

### Q-Learning in Nondeterministic Environments 🎲

- Many robotics environments are **nondeterministic**. An action in a state can lead to different successor states or rewards at different times.
- A nondeterministic Markov process has probabilistic transition P(s'|s, a) and reward r(s, a).
- Equation (10.16) is generalized by using the **expected value** over successor states:
  - Q(s, a) = E(r(s, a)) + γ ∑ s′ P(s′|s, a) max_a′ Q(s′, a′)
- Directly using (10.17) in a nondeterministic environment does **not guarantee convergence**. Successive runs might give different rewards/successor states, causing values to jump. ❌

<div class="mermaid">

    S --> S1: Action A (70%)
    S --> S2: Action A (30%)
    note left of S: Nondeterministic Transition
    style S fill:#f9f
</div>

---

### Stabilized Q-Learning (TD-Learning)

- To stabilize Q values in nondeterministic environments, the iteration rule adds the old Q value, weighted by (1 - αn).
- The learning rule becomes:
  - **Q̂n(s, a) = (1 − αn)Q̂n−1(s, a) + αn [ r(s, a) + γ max_a′ Q̂n−1(δ(s, a), a′) ]**
- Here, αn is a time-varying weighting factor, e.g., αn = 1 / (1 + bn(s, a)), where bn(s, a) is how often action 'a' was executed in state 's'.
- This stabilizes iteration, preventing excessive jumps in Q̂ values, especially later in learning when bn is large.
- This equation can be rewritten as:
  - Q̂n(s, a) = Q̂n−1(s, a) + α [ TD-error ]
- The term [ r(s, a) + γ max_a′ Q̂n−1(δ(s, a), a′) − Q̂n−1(s, a) ] is the **TD-error** (temporal difference error).
- This update rule is a special case of **TD-Learning**. α=1 is the basic Q-learning; α=0 means no learning. 🔄

### Exploration vs. Exploitation 🧭💰

- How should the agent choose actions during learning?
- **Possibility 1: Exploration**
  - Choose actions randomly. 🎲
  - Results in uniform exploration of possibilities.
  - **Slow convergence**. Guarantees visiting all state-action pairs infinitely often (required for convergence). ⏳
- **Possibility 2: Exploitation**
  - Always choose the action with the highest _current_ Q̂ value. 🏆
  - Results in relatively **fast convergence of a specific trajectory**.
  - Other paths may remain unvisited, potentially leading to **non-optimal policies**. ❌
- **Recommendation:** Use a **combination**, with high exploration initially, gradually reducing it over time. 🔄

### Approximation and Generalization 🧠✨

- Q-learning (and value iteration) as described use tables to store Q or V values. This only works for **finite, discrete state-action spaces**.
- If the state space is **infinite** (e.g., continuous variables), tables are impossible, and visiting all pairs is impossible.
- Solution: Replace the Q(s, a) table with a **function approximator**.
- A **neural network** (e.g., backpropagation network) is a common choice. Input is (s, a), target output is the Q value. 🧠
- Training examples update the network. Since there are finitely many examples for infinitely many inputs, this provides **generalization**.
- Other approximators like SVMs or Gaussian processes can also be used.

### Challenges with Function Approximation & POMDPs 🚧

- Q-learning with function approximation might **not converge**, as Theorem 10.1 requires visiting all state-action pairs infinitely often (which is impossible with continuous spaces). ❌
- Convergence problems can also occur with **POMDPs** (Partially Observable MDPs).
- In a POMDP, the agent perceives multiple states as one due to noisy sensors or intentional mapping to 'observations'.
- This mapping can reduce state space and prevent overfitting, but the agent cannot differentiate actual states within an observation.
- An action in an observation might lead to different successor states depending on the true underlying state, causing convergence issues for value iteration or Q-learning.

### Alternative Approaches: Policy Improvement 💪

- **Policy improvement methods** and **policy gradient methods** are alternative approaches.
- Instead of learning values (V or Q), they directly **change the policy**.
- The goal is to find a policy in the space of all policies that maximizes the cumulative discounted reward (Eq. 10.1).
- One way is to follow the **gradient of the cumulative reward** to a maximum. 📈
- This can significantly **speed up learning** in applications with large state spaces, like humanoid robots.

### AlphaGo: A Breakthrough in Go ♟️🤯

- Go has a huge branching factor, making traditional search methods difficult.
- **AlphaGo (Google DeepMind)** achieved a breakthrough.
- It combines **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for generating data, **deep learning** for evaluating positions, and **reinforcement learning** for strategy improvement.
- Learning goal: Learn a **policy p(a|s)** calculating the probability of winning for each move 'a' in position 's'. The best move is argmax_a p(a|s).
- **Stage 1: Deep Learning** based on expert games (KGS Go Server). A CNN learns pσ(a|s), predicting expert moves. It predicted expert moves up to 57% of the time. A simpler rollout policy pπ(a|s) was also trained.

### AlphaGo: Stages 2 & 3 and Final Play 🏆

- **Stage 2: Reinforcement Learning** to improve the policy pσ(a|s). AlphaGo plays against itself; the policy pρ(a|s) is improved using stochastic gradient descent. Plays against earlier versions to avoid overfitting.
- **Stage 3: Learning Value Function**. The policy pρ(a|s) trains a board state evaluation function V(s) using value iteration.
- **Final Play:** Uses a complex **MCTS algorithm**. Tree is expanded from the current position. Games are played to the end from leaf nodes using the fast rollout policy pπ(a|s). Position is evaluated using the game outcome + value function V(s).
- Required massive computation (1202 CPUs, 176 GPUs) to defeat Lee Sedol.
- AlphaGo was a major milestone, enabled by deep learning, RL, and engineering effort.

- It learns by playing against itself.
- Uses deep learning, reinforcement learning, and MCTS.
- A single deep network outputs both move probabilities and win probability.
- This network is trained using a new RL algorithm performing MCTS searches in games against itself to improve move probabilities. Chosen moves become stronger over time.

### The Curse of Dimensionality

- RL remains challenging, especially for **high-dimensional state and action spaces**.
- The huge computation time needed is known as the **"curse of dimensionality"**.
- How to address this? Look to nature. 🌿
- Learning in nature happens on **multiple levels of abstraction** (hierarchical learning). Learned skills are encapsulated and used as higher-level actions, reducing the action space. States can also be abstracted.

### Overcoming the Curse: Modular & Initial Policies 🧩🗺️

- **Distributed Learning / Multi-Agent Learning:** Complex control tasks (like a robot with many motors) can be broken down. Individual parts (e.g., each motor) get individual control, ideally independent of others, reducing complexity. Seen in insects (millipede legs).
- **Starting with a Good Initial Policy:** The task is easier if the agent starts with a somewhat good policy.
  - **Classical Programming:** Programmer provides an initial policy (a program). The agent follows this, leading it to "interesting" state-action areas, dramatically reducing the search space.
  - **Demonstration Learning:** A human "proscribes" (teaches) the actions, e.g., via remote control. The robot saves state-action pairs and generalizes using supervised learning (backpropagation, decision trees). This provides an initial policy for subsequent RL.

### Summary and Outlook ✨🔮

- Established learning algorithms like Value Iteration and Q-Learning exist.
- Training for complex RL applications is still demanding, requiring experimentation. Tools like the Teaching-Box can help by integrating various learning algorithms, traditional programming, and demonstration learning.
- RL is an **active and fascinating research area** with growing use.
- Scaling to **high-dimensional state and action spaces** remains a significant challenge (curse of dimensionality).
- Impressive results are achieved for small state/action spaces, but tasks with many degrees of freedom (like humanoid robots) are still very expensive to learn.
- Many variations and new algorithms exist beyond those presented.
